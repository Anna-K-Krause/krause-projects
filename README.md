## These files include some of the the NLP work I did over the Summer at Mutual of Omaha during my Internship.
## Wikipedia Scraping project
I peformed a supervised learning binary classification problem to predict the type of injury someone may have from two categories, "sports injuries" or "dislocations, sprains, or strains."

I performed sentiment analysis on a large dataset and found which words most strongly corresponded with positive or negative reviews.

## Motivation
Scraping - I was challenged by my coworkers to practice both web scraping and predictive NLP in a project.
UCI Drug Review - This was my first NLP project assigned using a known dataset with a variety of models

## Build status
Both projects are currently completed 

## Tech/framework used
I used Python through Jupyter Notebooks to do these projects.

## Features
I was able to incorporate advanced NLP features such as TFIDF successfully in both projects.

## Contribute

You can contribute and use your own analysis methods!
