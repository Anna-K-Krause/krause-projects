Achilles tendon rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Achilles_tendon_rupture,DSS," Achilles tendon rupture is when the Achilles tendon, at the back of the ankle, breaks.[5] Symptoms include the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel.[3] A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking becomes difficult.[4]
 Rupture typically occurs as a result of a sudden bending up of the foot when the calf muscle is engaged, direct trauma, or long-standing tendonitis.[4][5] Other risk factors include the use of fluoroquinolones, a significant change in exercise, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or corticosteroid use.[1][5] Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination and supported by medical imaging.[5]
 Prevention may include stretching before activity.[4] Treatment may be by surgery or casting with the toes somewhat pointed down.[6][5][2] Relatively rapid return to weight bearing (within 4 weeks) appears okay.[6][7] The risk of re-rupture is about 25% with casting.[5] If appropriate treatment does not occur within 4 weeks of the injury outcomes are not as good.[8]
 Achilles tendon rupture occurs in about 1 per 10,000 people per year.[5] Males are more commonly affected than females.[1] People in their 30s to 50s are most commonly affected.[5] The tendon itself was named in 1693 after the Greek hero Achilles.[9]
 The main symptoms is typically the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel.[3] A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking then becomes difficult.[4]
 The Achilles tendon is most commonly injured by sudden plantarflexion or dorsiflexion of the ankle, or by forced dorsiflexion of the ankle outside its normal range of motion.[citation needed]
 Other mechanisms by which the Achilles can be torn involve sudden direct trauma to the tendon, or sudden activation of the Achilles after atrophy from prolonged periods of inactivity. Some other common tears can occur from overuse while participating in intense sports. Twisting or jerking motions can also contribute to injury.[citation needed]
 Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, famously ciprofloxacin, are known to increase the risk of tendon rupture, particularly Achilles.[citation needed]
 People who commonly fall victim to Achilles rupture or tear include recreational athletes, people of old age, individuals with previous Achilles tendon tears or ruptures, previous tendon injections or quinolone use, extreme changes in training intensity or activity level, and participation in a new activity.[citation needed]
 Most cases of Achilles tendon rupture are traumatic sports injuries. The average age of patients is 29–40 years with a male-to-female ratio of nearly 20:1.  Direct steroid injections into the tendon have also been linked to rupture.
 The use of quinolone antibiotics can cause several forms of tendinitis and tendon rupture, including rupture of the Achilles tendon.  The risk is higher in people who are older than 60, who are also taking corticosteroids, or have kidney disease; it also increases with dose and taking them for longer periods of time. As of 2016 the mechanism through which quinolones cause this, was unclear.[10]
 The Achilles tendon is the strongest and thickest tendon in the body, connecting the gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris to the calcaneus. It is approximately 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) long and begins near the middle portion of the calf. Contraction of the gastrosoleus plantar flexes the foot, enabling such activities as walking, jumping, and running. The Achilles tendon receives its blood supply from its musculotendinous junction with the triceps surae and its innervation from the sural nerve and to a lesser degree from the tibial nerve.[citation needed]
 Diagnosis may be based on symptoms and the history of the event; typically people say it feels like being kicked or shot behind the ankle. Upon examination a gap may be felt just above the heel unless swelling has filled the gap and the Simmonds' test (aka Thompson test) will be positive; squeezing the calf muscles of the affected side while the person lies on their stomach, face down, with his feet hanging loose results in no movement (no passive plantarflexion) of the foot, while movement is expected with an intact Achilles tendon and should be observable upon manipulation of the uninvolved calf. Walking will usually be severely impaired, as the person will be unable to step off the ground using the injured leg. The person will also be unable to stand up on the toes of that leg, and pointing the foot downward (plantarflexion) will be impaired. Pain may be severe, and swelling is common.[citation needed]
 Sometimes an ultrasound scan may be required to clarify or confirm the diagnosis and is recommended over MRI.[11] MRI is generally not needed.[12]
 Musculoskeletal ultrasonography can be used to determine the tendon thickness, character, and presence of a tear. It works by sending extremely high frequencies of sound through the body. Some of these sounds are reflected back off the spaces between interstitial fluid and soft tissue or bone. These reflected images can be analyzed and computed into an image. These images are captured in real time and can be very helpful in detecting movement of the tendon and visualising possible injuries or tears. This device makes it very easy to spot structural damages to soft tissues, and consistent method of detecting this type of injury. This imaging modality is inexpensive, involves no ionizing radiation and, in the hands of skilled ultrasonographers, may be very reliable.
 MRI can be used to discern incomplete ruptures from degeneration of the Achilles tendon, and MRI can also distinguish between paratenonitis, tendinosis, and bursitis. This technique uses a strong uniform magnetic field to align millions of protons running through the body. These protons are then bombarded with radio waves that knock some of them out of alignment.  When these protons return they emit their own unique radio waves that can be analysed by a computer in 3D to create sharp cross sectional image of the area of interest. MRI can provide unparalleled contrast in soft tissue for an extremely high quality photograph making it easy for technicians to spot tears and other injuries.[citation needed]
 Radiography can also be used to indirectly identify Achilles tears. Radiography uses X-rays to analyse the point of injury. This is not very effective at identifying injuries to soft tissue. X-rays are created when high energy electrons hit a metal source. X-ray images are acquired by utilising the different attenuation characteristics of dense (e.g. calcium in bone) and less dense (e.g. muscle) tissues when these rays pass through tissue and are captured on film. X-rays are generally exposed to optimise visualisation of dense objects such as bone while soft tissue remains relatively undifferentiated in the background. Radiography has little role in assessment of Achilles' tendon injury and is more useful for ruling out other injuries such as calcaneal fractures.[13]
 Treatment options for an Achilles tendon rupture include surgical and non-surgical approaches.[2] While surgery has a lower risk of future rupture it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches.[2]
 Non-surgical management traditionally was selected for minor ruptures, less active patients, and those with medical conditions that prevent them from undergoing surgery. It traditionally consisted of restriction in a plaster cast for six to eight weeks with the foot pointed downwards (to oppose the ends of the ruptured tendon). But recent studies have produced superior results with much more rapid rehabilitation in fixed or hinged boots.[citation needed]
 Some surgeons feel an early surgical repair of the tendon is beneficial. The surgical option was long thought to offer a significantly smaller risk of re-rupture compared to traditional non-operative management (5% vs 15%).[14] Of course, surgery imposes higher risks of infection and bleeding.
 However, three recent studies have scientifically tested the benefits of surgery, using randomized streaming of patients into surgical and non-surgical protocols, and applying virtually identical (and aggressive) rehabilitation protocols to both types of patients. None of the three studies found statistically significant benefits from the surgery, separated from the other confounding variables. They all produced reasonably comparable results in re-rupture rates (with each study adding a cautious note about small sample size, one study showing 12% re-rupture in non-surgical treatment versus 4% re-rupture in surgical treatment, which is statistically insignificant), strength, and range of motion, while most have reaffirmed the greater complication rate from surgery.  Although the study met the sample size dictated by the authors’ a priori power calculation, the difference in the rerupture rate might be considered clinically important by some.[15][16][17][18]  Two studies showed small, but statistically significant differences in plantarflexion strength: The surgical group had significantly better results in the heel-rise work, heel-rise height, concentric power, and hopping tests at the 6-month evaluation than did the nonsurgical group. However, at the 12-month evaluation, there was a significant between-groups difference only in one test, the heel-rise work test.[18][19]
 The relative benefits of surgical and nonsurgical treatments remains a subject of debate; authors of studies are cautious about the preferred treatment.[19] In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates.[20]
 There are two different types of surgeries; open surgery and percutaneous surgery.
 During an open surgery an incision is made in the back of the leg and the Achilles tendon is stitched together. In a complete or serious rupture the tendon of plantaris or another vestigial muscle is harvested and wrapped around the Achilles tendon, increasing the strength of the repaired tendon.[21] If the tissue quality is poor, e.g. the injury has been neglected, the surgeon might use a reinforcement mesh (collagen, Artelon or other degradable material).
 In percutaneous surgery, the surgeon makes several small incisions, rather than one large incision, and sews the tendon back together through the incision(s). Surgery may be delayed for about a week after the rupture to let the swelling go down.[22] For sedentary patients and those who have vasculopathy or risks for poor healing, percutaneous surgical repair may be a better treatment choice than open surgical repair.[23]
 Non-surgical treatment used to involve very long periods in a series of casts, and took longer to complete than surgical treatment. But both surgical and non-surgical rehabilitation protocols have recently become quicker, shorter, more aggressive, and more successful. It used to be that patients who underwent surgery would wear a cast for approximately 4 to 8 weeks after surgery and were only allowed to gently move the ankle once out of the cast. Recent studies have shown that patients have quicker and more successful recoveries when they are allowed to move and lightly stretch their ankle immediately after surgery. To keep their ankle safe these patients use a removable boot while walking and doing daily activities. Modern studies including non-surgical patients generally limit non-weight-bearing (NWB) to two weeks, and use modern removable boots, either fixed or hinged, rather than casts. Physiotherapy is often begun as early as two weeks following the start of either kind of treatment.[citation needed]
 There are three things that need to be kept in mind while rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles: range of motion, functional strength, and sometimes orthotic support. Range of motion is important because it takes into mind the tightness of the repaired tendon. When beginning rehab a patient should perform stretches lightly and increase the intensity as time and pain permits. Putting linear stress on the tendon is important because it stimulates connective tissue repair, which can be achieved while performing the “runners stretch,” (putting your toes a couple inches up the wall while your heel is on the ground). Doing stretches to gain functional strength are also important because it improves healing in the tendon, which will in turn lead to a quicker return to activities. These stretches should be more intense and should involve some sort of weight bearing, which helps reorient and strengthen the collagen fibers in the injured ankle. A popular stretch used for this phase of rehabilitation is the toe raise on an elevated surface. The patient is to push up onto the toes and lower his or her self as far down as possible and repeat several times. The other part of the rehab process is orthotic support. This doesn’t have anything to do with stretching or strengthening the tendon, rather it is in place to keep the patient comfortable. These are custom made inserts that fit into the patients shoe and help with proper pronation of the foot, which is otherwise a problem that can lead to problems with the Achilles.[citation needed]
 To briefly summarize the steps of rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles tendon, you should begin with range of motion type stretching. This will allow the ankle to get used to moving again and get ready for weight bearing activities. Then there is functional strength, this is where weight bearing should begin in order to start strengthening the tendon and getting it ready to perform daily activities and eventually in athletic situations.[24][25]

ALPSA lesion,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/ALPSA_lesion,DSS," An ALPSA (anterior labral periosteal sleeve avulsion) lesion is an injury at the front of the shoulder associated with shoulder dislocation.
 The shoulder joint is made up of the glenoid and humeral head.  The humeral head is ball shaped but the glenoid is more dish shaped than cup shaped.  To aid stability of the joint, the glenoid has a soft tissue bumper around its edge (the labrum) which acts as a bumper preventing dislocation of the head from the glenoid.
 The anterior (front) labrum can peel off the glenoid resulting in a Bankart lesion.  When the periosteum (fibrous tissue surrounding bone) peels off as well this is called an ALPSA lesion.  When this happens the labrum (bumper) falls away and rolls up.  It normally falls medially and downwards.
 If required, the labrum and periosteum can be reattached, recreating the bumper affect, aiding shoulder stability and hopefully preventing further dislocation.  It can be done by Arthroscopic techniques or with open surgery. The injury cannot always be repaired.

Anterior cruciate ligament injury,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury,DSS," Anterior cruciate ligament injury is when the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is either stretched, partially torn, or completely torn.[1] The most common injury is a complete tear.[1] Symptoms include pain, a popping sound during injury, instability of the knee, and joint swelling.[1] Swelling generally appears within a couple of hours.[2] In approximately 50% of cases, other structures of the knee such as surrounding ligaments, cartilage, or meniscus are damaged.[1]
 The underlying mechanism often involves a rapid change in direction, sudden stop, landing after a jump, or direct contact to the knee.[1] It is more common in athletes, particularly those who participate in alpine skiing, football (soccer), American football, or basketball.[1][5] Diagnosis is typically made by physical examination and is sometimes supported by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[1] Physical examination will often show tenderness around the knee joint, reduced range of motion of the knee, and increased looseness of the joint.[6]
 Prevention is by neuromuscular training and core strengthening.[3][4] Treatment recommendations depend on desired level of activity.[1] In those with low levels of future activity, nonsurgical management including bracing and physiotherapy may be sufficient.[1] In those with high activity levels, surgical repair via arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is often recommended.[1] This involves replacement with a tendon taken from another area of the body or from a cadaver.[6] Following surgery rehabilitation involves slowly expanding the range of motion of the joint, and strengthening the muscles around the knee.[1] Surgery, if recommended, is generally not performed until the initial inflammation from the injury has resolved.[1]
 About 200,000 people are affected per year in the United States.[2] In some sports, females have a higher risk of ACL injury, while in others, both sexes are equally affected.[5][7] Many people with a complete tear who do not receive surgery are unable to play sports, and may develop osteoarthritis.[2]
 When an individual has an ACL injury, they are likely to hear a ""pop"" in their knee followed by pain and swelling. They may also experience instability in the knee once they resume walking and other activities, as the ligament can no longer stabilize the knee joint and keep the tibia from sliding forward.[8]
 Reduced range of motion of the knee and tenderness along the joint line are also common signs of an acute ACL injury. The pain and swelling may resolve on its own; however, the knee will remain unstable and returning to sport without treatment may result in further damage to the knee.[1]
 Causes may include:
 These movements cause the tibia to shift away from the femur rapidly, placing strain on the knee joint and potentially leading to rupture of the ACL. About 80% of ACL injuries occur without direct trauma.[9]
 Female athletes are two to eight times more likely to strain their ACL in sports that involve cutting and jumping as compared to men who play the same particular sports.[10] NCAA data has found relative rates of injury per 1000 athlete exposures as follows:
 The highest rate of ACL injury in women occurred in gymnastics, with a rate of injury per 1000 athlete exposures of 0.33.
Of the four sports with the highest ACL injury rates, three were women's – gymnastics, basketball and soccer.[11]
 Differences between males and females identified as potential causes are the active muscular protection of the knee joint, differences in leg/pelvis alignment, and relative ligament laxity caused by differences in hormonal activity from estrogen and relaxin.[10][12] Birth control pills appear to decrease the risk.[13]
 Some studies have suggested that there are four neuromuscular imbalances that predispose women to higher incidence of ACL injury. Female athletes are more likely to jump and land with their knees relatively straight and collapsing in towards each other, while most of their bodyweight falls on a single foot and their upper body tilts to one side.[14] Several theories have been described to further explain these imbalances. These include the ligament dominance, quadriceps dominance, leg dominance, and trunk dominance theories.
 The ligament dominance theory suggests that when females athletes land after a jump, their muscles do not sufficiently absorb the impact of the ground. As a result, the ligaments of the knee must absorb the force, leading to a higher risk of injury.[15] Quadriceps dominance refers to a tendency of female athletes to preferentially use the quadriceps muscles to stabilize the knee joint.[15] Given that the quadriceps muscles work to pull the tibia forward, an overpowering contraction of the quadriceps can place strain on the ACL, increasing risk of injury.
 Leg dominance describes the observation that women tend to place more weight on one leg than another.[16] Finally, trunk dominance suggests that males typically exhibit greater control of the trunk in performance situations as evidenced by greater activation of the internal oblique muscle.[15] Female athletes are more likely land with their upper body tilted to one side and more weight on one leg than the other, therefore placing greater rotational force on their knees.[17]
 Before puberty, there is no observed difference in frequency of ACL tears between the sexes. Changes in sex hormone levels, specifically elevated levels of estrogen and relaxin in females during the menstrual cycle, have been hypothesized as causing predisposition of ACL ruptures. This is because they may increase joint laxity and extensibility of the soft tissues surrounding the knee joint.[10]
 Additionally, female pelvises widen during puberty through the influence of sex hormones. This wider pelvis requires the femur to angle toward the knees. This angle towards the knee is referred to as the Q angle. The average Q angle for men is 14 degrees and the average for women is 17 degrees. Steps can be taken to reduce this Q angle, such as using orthotics.[18] The relatively wider female hip and widened Q angle may lead to an increased likelihood of ACL tears in women. 
 During puberty, sex hormones also affect the remodeled shape of soft tissues throughout the body. The tissue remodeling results in female ACLs that are smaller and will fail (i.e. tear) at lower loading forces, and differences in ligament and muscular stiffness between men and women. Women's knees are less stiff than men's during muscle activation. Force applied to a less stiff knee is more likely to result in ACL tears.[19]
 In addition, the quadriceps femoris muscle is an antagonist to the ACL. According to a study done on female athletes at the University of Michigan, 31% of female athletes recruited the quadriceps femoris muscle first as compared to 17% in males. Because of the elevated contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle during physical activity, an increased strain is placed onto the ACL due to the ""tibial translation anteriorly"".[20]
 The knee joint is formed by three bones: the femur (thighbone), the tibia (shinbone), and the patella (kneecap). These bones are held together by ligaments, which are strong bands of tissue that keep the joint stable while an individual is walking, running, jumping, etc. There are two types of ligaments in the knee: the collateral ligaments and the cruciate ligaments.
 The collateral ligaments include the medial collateral ligament (along the inside of the knee) and the lateral or fibular collateral ligament (along the outside of the knee). These two ligaments function to limit sideways movement of the knee.[6]
 The cruciate ligaments form an “X” inside the knee joint with the anterior cruciate ligament running from the front of the tibia to the back of the femur, and the posterior cruciate ligament running from the back of the tibia to the front of the femur. The anterior cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur and provides rotational stability.[6]
 There are also two C-shaped structures made of cartilage called the medial meniscus and lateral meniscus that sit on top of the tibia in the knee joint and serve as cushion for the bones.[1]  
 Most ACL injuries can be diagnosed by examining the knee and comparing it to the other, non-injured knee. When a doctor suspects ACL injury in a person who reports a popping sound in the knee followed by swelling, pain, and instability of the knee joint, they can perform several tests to evaluate the damage to the knee. These tests include the pivot-shift test, anterior drawer test, and Lachman test. The pivot-shift test involves flexing the knee while holding onto the ankle and slightly rotating the tibia inwards.[21] In the anterior drawer test, the examiner flexes the knees to 90 degrees, sits on the person's feet, and gently pulls the tibia towards him or herself.[22] The Lachman test is performed by placing one hand on the person's thigh and the other on the tibia and pulling the tibia forward.[23] These tests are meant to test whether the ACL is intact and therefore able to limit the forward motion of the tibia. The Lachman test is recognized by most authorities as the most reliable and sensitive of the three.[24]
 Though clinical examination in experienced hands can be accurate, the diagnosis is usually confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which provides images of the soft tissues like ligaments and cartilage around the knee.[1] It may also permit visualization of other structures which may have been coincidentally involved, such as the menisci or collateral ligaments.[25] An x-ray may be performed in addition to evaluate whether one of the bones in the knee joint was broken during the injury.[8]
 MRI is perhaps the most used technique for diagnosing the state of the ACL, but it is not always the most reliable technique as the ACL can be obscured by blood that fills the joint after an injury.[26]
 Another form of evaluation that may be used in case physical examination and MRI are inconclusive is laximetry testing (i.e. arthrometry and stress imaging), which involve applying a force to the leg and quantifying the resulting displacement of the knee.[26]
 An injury to a ligament is called a sprain. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons defines ACL injury in terms of severity and classifies them as Grade 1, 2, or 3 sprains.[1] Grade 1 sprains occur when the ligament is stretched slightly but the stability of the knee joint is not affected. Grade 2 sprains occur when the ligament is stretched to the point that it becomes loose; this is also referred to as a partial tear. Grade 3 sprains occur when the ligament is completely torn into two pieces, and the knee joint is no longer stable. This is the most common type of ACL injury.
 Around half of ACL injuries occur in conjunction with injury to other structures in the knee, including the other ligaments, menisci, or cartilage on the surface of the bones. A specific pattern of injury called the “unhappy triad” (also known as the ""terrible triad,"" or ""O'Donoghue's triad"") involves injury to the ACL, MCL, and medial meniscus, and occurs when a lateral force is applied to the knee while the foot is fixed on the ground.[27]
 Interest in reducing non-contact ACL injury has been intense. The International Olympic Committee, after a comprehensive review of preventive strategies, has stated that injury prevention programs have a measurable effect on reducing injuries.[28] These programs are especially important in female athletes who bear higher incidence of ACL injury than male athletes, and also in children and adolescents who are at high risk for a second ACL tear.[29][30]
 Researchers have found that female athletes often land with the knees relatively straight and collapsing inwards towards each other, with most of their bodyweight on a single foot and their upper body tilting to one side; these four factors put excessive strain on the ligaments on the knee and thus increase the likelihood of ACL tear.[31][15] There is evidence that engaging in neuromuscular training (NMT), which focus on hamstring strengthening, balance, and overall stability to reduce risk of injury by enhancing movement patterns during high risk movements. Such programs are beneficial for all athletes, particularly adolescent female athletes.[32][17]
 Nonsurgical treatment for ACL rupture (also referred to as ""conservative management"") is suggested for individuals who are not highly active or engage in sports that cutting and twisting motions, and often includes physical therapy and the use of a hinged knee brace.
In athletes or individuals with additional knee injuries such as damage to the cartilage, menisci or other ligaments, surgery is usually advised.[2]
 A torn ACL will not heal without surgery (i.e. the torn pieces will not come back together to form a functional ligament). However, if the knee remains stable enough to allow for walking and the individual does not plan to participate in high level of activity, doctors will recommend bracing and physical therapy rather than surgery.[1] 
 Rest, icing, compression, and elevation may be recommended. A brace may be used to protect the knee form instability, and crutches may be used to prevent weight-bearing while the knee is healing.[33] As swelling goes down, physical therapy may help restore function to the knee and strengthen the surrounding muscles (hamstring and quads) so that the muscles can compensate for the torn ligament and stabilize the knee.
 ACL reconstruction surgery involves replacing the torn ACL with a “graft,” which is a tendon taken from another source. Grafts can be taken from the patellar tendon, hamstring tendon, quadriceps tendon from either the patient (""autograft"") or a cadaver (""allograft""). The graft serves as scaffolding upon which new ligament tissue will grow.[1]
 The surgery is done with an arthroscope or tiny camera inserted inside the knee, with additional small incisions made around the knee to insert surgical instruments. This method is less invasive and is proven to result in less pain from surgery, less time in the hospital, and quicker recovery times than “open” surgery (in which a long incision is made down the front of the knee and the joint is opened and exposed).[1]
 The timing of ACL reconstruction has been controversial, with some studies showing worse outcomes when surgery is done immediately after injury, and others showing no difference in outcomes when surgery is done immediately compared to when surgery is delayed.[34][35] The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons has stated that there is moderate evidence to support the guideline that ACL reconstruction should occur within five months of injury in order to improve patient function and protect the knee from further injury; however, additional studies need to be done to determine the best time for surgery and to better understand the effect of timing on clinical outcomes.[36]
 The goals of rehabilitation following an ACL injury are to regain knee strength and motion. If an individual with an ACL injury undergoes surgery, the rehabilitation process will first focus on slowly increasing the range of motion of the joint, then on strengthening the surrounding muscles to protect the new ligament and stabilize the knee. Finally, functional training specific to the activities required for certain sports is begun. It may take six or more months before an athlete can return to sport after surgery, as it is vital to regain a sense of balance and control over the knee in order to prevent a second injury.[6]
 The prognosis of ACL injury is generally good, with many people regaining function of the injured leg within months.[6] ACL injury used to be a career-ending injury for competitive athletes; however, in recent years ACL reconstruction surgery followed by physical therapy has allowed many athletes to return to their pre-injury level of performance.[37]
 Long term complications of ACL injury include early onset arthritis of the knee and/or re-tearing the ligament. Factors that increase risk of arthritis include severity of the initial injury, injury to other structures in the knee, and level of activity following treatment.[8] Not repairing tears to the ACL can sometimes cause damage to the cartilage inside the knee because with the torn ACL, the tibia and femur bone are more likely to rub against each other.[1]
 Unfortunately, young female athletes have a significant risk of re-tearing a repaired ACL, or tearing the ACL on the other knee after their recovery. This risk has been recorded as being nearly 1 out of every 4 young athletes.[38] Therefore, athletes should be screened for any neuromuscular deficit (i.e. weakness greater in one leg than another, or incorrect landing form) before returning to sport.[14]
 There are around 200,000 ACL tears each year in the United States, with over 100,000 ACL reconstruction surgeries per year. Over 95% of ACL reconstructions are performed in the outpatient setting. The most common procedures performed during ACL reconstruction are partial meniscectomy and chondroplasty.[39]
 High school athletes are at increased risk for ACL tears when compared to non-athletes. This risk increases with certain types of sports. Among high school girls in the US, the sport with the highest risk of ACL tear is soccer, followed by basketball and lacrosse. The highest risk sport for high school boys in the US was basketball, followed by lacrosse and soccer.[40]
 Children and young athletes may benefit from early surgical reconstruction after ACL injury. Young athletes who have early surgical reconstruction of their torn ACL are more likely to return to their previous level of athletic ability when compared to those who underwent delayed surgery or nonoperative treatment. They are also less likely to experience instability in their knee if they undergo early surgery.[41]

Bankart lesion,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Bankart_lesion,DSS," A Bankart lesion is an injury of the anterior (inferior) glenoid labrum of the shoulder due to anterior shoulder dislocation.[1] When this happens, a pocket at the front of the glenoid forms that allows the humeral head to dislocate into it. It is an indication for surgery and often accompanied by a Hill-Sachs lesion, damage to the posterior humeral head.[2]
 The Bankart lesion is named after English orthopedic surgeon Arthur Sydney Blundell Bankart (1879–1951).[3]
 A bony Bankart is a Bankart lesion that includes a fracture in of the anterior-inferior glenoid cavity of the scapula bone.[4]
 The diagnosis is usually initially made by a combination of physical exam and medical imaging, where the latter may be projectional radiography (in cases of bony Bankart) and/or MRI of the shoulder. The presence of intra-articular contrast allows for better evaluation of the glenoid labrum.[5] Type V SLAP tears extends into the Bankart defect.[6]
 Arthroscopic repair of Bankart injuries have good success rates, though nearly one-third of patients require further surgery for continued instability after the initial procedure in a study of young adults, with higher re-operation rates in those less than 20 years of age.[7] Options for repair include an arthroscopic technique or a more invasive open Latarjet procedure,[8] with the open technique tending to have a lower incidence of recurrent dislocation, but also a reduced range of motion following surgery.[9]

Biceps femoris tendon rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Biceps_femoris_tendon_rupture,DSS," Biceps femoris tendon rupture can occur when the biceps femoris is injured in sports that require explosive bending of the knee as seen in sprinting. If the athlete is fatigued or has not warmed up properly he/she may suffer a hamstring strain/rupture, which is the tearing of the hamstring muscle. Avulsion of the biceps femoris tendon, is the complete pulling away of the tendon from the bone. This most commonly occurs where the long head attaches to the ischial tuberosity. Injuries to biceps femoris are more common than to other hamstring muscles.
 One theory for this is the fact that each of the two heads are innervated by different branches of the sciatic nerve. In states of fatigue or when the muscle is not fully warmed up, uncoordinated firing of the nerves may cause the muscle to contract inappropriately during movement, leading to injury. Biceps femoris tendon avulsion may also be associated with an avulsion fracture which occurs when a piece of the bone is pulled away with the tendon, during forceful contraction.
 Isolated avulsion is rare.[1]
 The R.I.C.E. technique should be administered, however a sports injury specialist is recommended for the possibility of surgery.
"
Biceps tendon rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Biceps_tendon_rupture,DSS," A biceps tendon rupture is a complete or partial rupture of a tendon of the biceps brachii muscle. It can affect the distal tendon, or either/both of the proximal tendons, attached to the long and short head of the muscle, respectively.
 A biceps tendon rupture may occur during athletic activities, however avulsion injuries of the distal biceps tendon are frequently occupational in nature and sustained during forceful, eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle while lifting.[1]
 Acute rupture of the distal biceps tendon can be treated nonoperatively with acceptable results,[2] but because the injury can lead to 30% loss of elbow flexion strength and 30-50% loss of forearm supination strength, surgical repair is generally recommended.[3][4][5] Complete distal biceps tears are commonly treated with re-attachment of the biceps tendon to its native insertion on the tuberosity of the radius using bone tunnels, suture buttons, or suture anchors.[6][3][7]  Proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon can be surgically addressed by two different techniques. Biceps tenodesis includes release of the long head of the biceps tendon off of its insertion on the glenoid and re-attachment by screw or suture anchor fixation to the humerus. Biceps tenotomy consists of simple release of the long head of the biceps without reattachment to the humerus, allowing the tendon to retract into the soft tissues of the proximal upper arm.[1] Degeneration of the tendon can cause partial tears and are rarely associated with a traumatic event. 
 Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury.  In most cases, the muscle will heal over time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery.[8]

Cuboid syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Cuboid_syndrome,DSS," Cuboid syndrome or cuboid subluxation describes a condition that results from subtle injury to the calcaneocuboid joint[1] and ligaments in the vicinity of the cuboid bone, one of seven tarsal bones of the human foot.
 This condition often manifests in the form of lateral (little toe side) foot pain and sometimes general foot weakness. Cuboid syndrome, which is relatively common but not well defined or recognized,[2] is known by many other names, including lateral plantar neuritis, cuboid fault syndrome, peroneal cuboid syndrome, dropped cuboid, locked cuboid and subluxed cuboid.[1][3]
 A patient with cuboid syndrome usually seeks medical advice and attention complaining of pain, discomfort, or weakness along the lateral aspect of the foot between the fourth and fifth metatarsals and the calcaneocuboid joint.[1] The pain may radiate throughout the foot.[1] Tenderness may be elicited over the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle and an antalgic gait may be observed.[1] The pain may be observed in a controlled environment by standing on the toes or rolling the arches of the foot, as these motions tend to exercise the foot's calcaneocuboid joint and ligament, which are characteristically strained in a patient suffering from cuboid syndrome.[4] 
Also, the pain may come on suddenly or it may develop gradually and persist over time.
Sometimes the pain is intermittent, subsiding partially or completely for a period of time before returning again.[3]
 A patient may develop Cuboid syndrome through either a single traumatic event (e.g., ankle sprain) or insidiously with repetitive strain over time.[1] The exact etiology of Cuboid syndrome remains unclear but many ideas have been proposed. Such ideas include excessive pronation of the foot, overuse injury, and inversion ankle sprains.[1] The favored idea is that the cuboid bone is forcefully everted while the calcaneus is inverted resulting in incongruity at the calcaneocuboid joint.[1] The condition mainly affects athletes, especially those whose activities incur a significant amount of pressure on their feet from jumping or running (such as ballet dancers[5] and runners) and those who place added strain on their feet during lateral maneuvering (such as tennis and basketball players[3][4]). Cuboid syndrome may persist even if the patient is taking part in regular physical therapy.[3] The patient's foot type, such as the presence of overpronation or underpronation, may also play a factor in the condition.
 Suspected risk factors for Cuboid syndrome include obesity, midtarsal instability, poorly fitting footwear, physical exercise, inadequate recovery from physical activity, physical training on uneven surfaces, and ankle sprains.[1]
 Once diagnosed, a medical professional may treat cuboid syndrome by realigning (also known as reducing) the subluxed cuboid unless contraindications to manipulation are present such as gout, inflammatory arthritis, bony disease, neurovascular compromise, or a bone fracture.[1][3] This form of manual manipulation of the foot should be done by a trained specialist, such as a podiatrist, chiropractor, osteopath, athletic trainer, osteopathic physician, or physical therapist. Further treatment may take into account other considerations, such as possible causes or aggravators (e.g. recommending that the patient be fit with custom orthotics if they are overprone). Fortunately, subluxed cuboids are generally quite treatable[4] and most patients return to a normal level of activity once the pain is brought under control.[3]

Dislocated shoulder,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Dislocated_shoulder,DSS," A dislocated shoulder is when the head of the humerus is out of the shoulder joint.[2] Symptoms include shoulder pain and instability.[2] Complications may include a Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, rotator cuff tear, or injury to the axillary nerve.[1]
 A shoulder dislocation often occurs as a result of a fall onto an outstretched arm or onto the shoulder.[3] Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and confirmed by X-rays.[2] They are classified as anterior, posterior, inferior, and superior with most being anterior.[2][1]
 Treatment is by shoulder reduction which may be accomplished by a number of techniques.[1] These include traction-countertraction, external rotation, scapular manipulation, and the Stimson technique.[1] After reduction X-rays are recommended for verification.[1] The arm may then be placed in a sling for a few weeks.[2] Surgery may be recommended in those with recurrent dislocations.[2]
 About 1.7% of people have a shoulder dislocation within their lifetime.[3] In the United States this is about 24 per 100,000 people per year.[1] They make up about half of major joint dislocations seen in emergency departments.[1] Males are affected more often than females.[1]
 A diagnosis of shoulder dislocation is often suspected based on patient history and physical examination. Radiographs are made to confirm the diagnosis. Most dislocations are apparent on radiographs showing incongruence of the glenohumeral joint. Posterior dislocations may be hard to detect on standard AP radiographs, but are more readily detected on other views. After reduction, radiographs are usually repeated to confirm successful reduction and to detect bony damage. After repeated shoulder dislocations, an MRI scan may be used to assess soft tissue damage. In regards to recurrent dislocations, the apprehension test (anterior instability) and sulcus sign (inferior instability) are useful methods for determining predisposition to future dislocation.
 There are three main types of dislocations: anterior, posterior, and inferior.
 In over 95% of shoulder dislocations, the humerus is displaced anteriorly.[6]  In most of those, the head of the humerus comes to rest under the coracoid process, referred to as sub-coracoid dislocation.  Sub-glenoid, subclavicular, and, very rarely, intrathoracic or retroperitoneal dislocations may also occur.[7]
 Anterior dislocations are usually caused by a direct blow to, or fall on, an outstretched arm. The patient typically holds his/her arm externally rotated and slightly abducted.
 A Hill–Sachs lesion is an impaction of the head of the humerus left by the glenoid rim during dislocation.[5] Hill-Sachs deformities occur in 35–40% of anterior dislocations. They can be seen on a front-facing X-ray when the arm is in internal rotation.[8] Bankart lesions are disruptions of the glenoid labrum with or without an avulsion of bone fragment.
 Damage to the axillary artery[9] and axillary nerve (C5,C6) may result. The axillary nerve is injured in 37% making it the most commonly injured structure with this type of injury.[10] Other common, associated, nerve injuries include injury to the suprascapular nerve (29%) and the radial nerve (22%).[10]  Axillary nerve damage results in a weakened or paralyzed deltoid muscle and as the deltoid atrophies unilaterally, the normal rounded contour of the shoulder is lost. A patient with injury to the axillary nerve will have difficulty in abducting the arm from approximately 15° away from the body. The supraspinatus muscle initiates abduction from a fully adducted position.
 An anterior dislocation of the shoulder

 Posterior dislocations are uncommon, and are typically due to the muscle contraction from electric shock or seizure.[5] They may be caused by strength imbalance of the rotator cuff muscles. Patients typically present holding their arm internally rotated and adducted, and exhibiting flattening of the anterior shoulder with a prominent coracoid process.
 Posterior dislocations may go unrecognized, especially in an elderly patient[11] and in the unconscious trauma patient.[12] An average interval of 1 year was noted between injury and diagnosis in a series of 40 patients.[13]
 Inferior dislocation is the least likely, occurring in less than 1%.  This condition is also called luxatio erecta because the arm appears to be permanently held upward or behind the head.[14]  It is caused by a hyper abduction of the arm that forces the humeral head against the acromion.[15]  Such injuries have a high complication rate as many vascular, neurological, tendon, and ligament injuries are likely to occur from this mechanism of injury.
 Prompt medical treatment should be sought for suspected dislocation.
Usually, the shoulder is kept in its current position by use of a splint or sling.  A pillow between the arm and torso may provide support and increase comfort. Strong analgesics are needed to allay the pain of a dislocation and the distress associated with it.
 Shoulder reduction may be accomplished with a number of techniques including traction-countertraction, external rotation, scapular manipulation, Stimson technique, Cunningham technique, or Milch technique.[1][3] Pain can be managed during the procedures either by procedural sedation and analgesia or injected lidocaine into the shoulder joint.[16] Injecting lidocaine into the joint may be less expensive and faster.[4] If a shoulder cannot be relocated in the emergency room, relocation in the operating room may be required.[1] This situation occurs in about 7% of cases.[1]
 There does not appear to be any difference in outcomes when the arm is immobilized in internal versus external rotation following an anterior shoulder dislocation.[17][18][needs update] A 2008 study of 300 people for almost six years found that conventional shoulder immobilisation in a sling offered no benefit.[19]
 In young adults engaged in highly demanding activities shoulder surgery may be considered.[20] Arthroscopic surgery techniques may be used to repair the glenoidal labrum, capsular ligaments, biceps long head anchor or SLAP lesion or to tighten the shoulder capsule.[21]
 Arthroscopic stabilization surgery has evolved from the Bankart repair, a time-honored surgical treatment for recurrent anterior instability of the shoulder.[22] However, the failure rate following Bankart repair has been shown to increase markedly in patients with significant bone loss from the glenoid (socket).[23]  In such cases, improved results have been reported with some form of bone augmentation of the glenoid such as the Latarjet operation.[24][25][26]
 Although posterior dislocation is much less common, instability following it is no less challenging and, again, some form of bone augmentation may be required to control instability.[27]
 There remains those situations characterized by multidirectional instability, which have failed to respond satisfactorily to rehabilitation, falling under the AMBRI classification previously noted. This is usually due to an overstretched and redundant capsule which no longer offers stability or support.  Traditionally, this has responded well to a 'reefing' procedure known as an open inferior capsular shift.[28] More recently, the procedure has been carried out as an arthroscopic procedure, rather than open surgery, again with comparable results.[28] Most recently, the procedure has been carried out using radio frequency technology to shrink the redundant shoulder capsule (thermal capsular shrinkage);[29] while long-term results of this development are currently unproven, recent studies show thermal capsular shrinkage have higher failure rates with the highest incidence of instability recurrence and re-operation.[26]
 After an anterior shoulder dislocation, the risk of a future dislocation is about 20%. This risk is greater in males than females.[30]

Dislocation of jaw,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Dislocation_of_jaw,DSS," Dislocations occur when two bones that originally met at the joint detach.[1] Dislocations should not be confused with Subluxation. Subluxation is when the joint is still partially attached to the bone.[2]
 When a person has a dislocated jaw it is difficult to open and close the mouth.[3] Dislocation can occur following a series of events if the jaw locks while open or unable to close. If the jaw is dislocated, it may cause an extreme headache or inability to concentrate. When the muscle's alignment is out of sync, a pain will occur due to unwanted rotation of the jaw.[4]
 If the pain remains constant, it may require surgery to realign the jaw.[5] Depending on the severity of the jaw's dislocation, pain relief such as paracetamol may assist to alleviate the initial chronic pain. If the pain relief is taken for an extended period of time, it may negatively affect the person while talking, eating, drinking, etc.
 The symptoms can be numerous depending on the severity of the dislocation injury and how long the person is inflicted with the injury. Symptoms of a dislocated jaw include a bite that feels “off” or abnormal, hard time talking or moving jaw, not able to close mouth completely, drooling due to not being able to shut mouth completely, teeth feel they are out of alignment, and a pain that becomes unbearable[6]
 The immediate symptom can be a loud crunch noise occurring right up against the ear drum.  This is instantly followed by excruciating pain, particularly in the side where the dislocation occurred.[citation needed]
 Short-term symptoms can range from mild to chronic headaches, muscle tension or pain in the face, jaw and neck.[citation needed]
 Long-term symptoms can result in sleep deprivation, tiredness/lethargy, frustration, bursts of anger or short fuse, difficulty performing everyday tasks, depression, social issues relating to difficulty talking, hearing sensitivity (particularly to high pitched sounds), tinnitus and pain when seated associated with posture while at a computer and reading books from general pressure on the jaw and facial muscles when tilting head down or up. And possible causing subsequent facial asymmetry.[citation needed]
 In contrast, symptoms of a fractured jaw include bleeding coming from the mouth, unable to open the mouth wide without pain, bruising and swelling of the face, difficulty eating due to the constant pain, loss of feeling in the face (more specifically the lower lip) and lacks full range of motion of the jaw.[6]
 The joint involved with jaw dislocation is the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This joint is located where the mandibular condyles and the temporal bone meet.[7][8] Membranes that surround the bones help during the hinging and gliding of jaw movement. For the mouth to close it requires the following muscles: the masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid muscle. For the jaw to open it requires the lateral pterygoid muscle.[8]
 There are four different positions of jaw dislocation: posterior, anterior, superior and lateral. The most common position is anterior, while the other types are rare. Anterior dislocation shifts the lower jaw forward if the mouth excessively opens. This type of dislocation may happen bilaterally or unilaterally after yawning. The muscles that are affected during anterior jaw dislocation are the masseter and temporalis which pull up on the mandible and the lateral pterygoid which relaxes the mandibular condyle. The condyle can get locked in front of the articular eminence. Posterior dislocation is possible for people who get injured by being punched in the chin. This dislocation will push the jaw back affecting the alignment of the mandibular condyle and mastoid. The external auditory canal may be fractured. Superior dislocations occur after being punched below the mandibular ramus as the mouth remains half-open. Since great force occurs in a punch, the angle of the jaw will be forced upward moving towards the condylar head. This can result in a fracture of the glenoid fossa and displacement of the condyle into the middle cranial fossa, potentially injuring the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves and the temporal lobe. Lateral dislocations move the mandibular condyle away from the skull and are likely to happen together with jaw fractures.[8][9]
 Posterior, superior and lateral dislocations are uncommon injuries and usually result from high-energy trauma to the chin. By contrast, anterior dislocations are more often the result of low-energy trauma (e.g. tooth extraction) or secondary to a medical condition that affects the stability of the joint (e.g. seizures, ligamentous laxity, degeneration of joint capsule).
 As with other joint dislocations, clinical history and examination are crucial for diagnosis of a jaw dislocation. Commonly, plain and panoramic X-ray radiographies are used to determine the relative position of the mandibular condyle. If a complex or unusual injury is suspected, three-dimensional computed tomography is most reliable in diagnosing dislocation and possibly associated fractures or soft tissue injuries.
 In case of dislocations resulting from high-energy trauma, attention must also be paid to possible other injuries, particularly blunt or indirect trauma to the skull and cervical spine. Acutely life-threatening conditions need to be ruled out or treated in first line. For superior jaw dislocation in particular, serious intracranial complications such as epidural hematoma are possible and must be recognized and managed to prevent disability or even death. Therefore, neurological status has to be examined in patients with complex dislocations involving temporal bone fractures. Hearing deficits on the injured side may indicate damage to structures of the ear. [10][11]
 Most temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are self-limiting and do not get worse. Simple treatment, involving self-care practices, rehabilitation aimed at eliminating muscle spasms, and restoring correct coordination, is all that is required. Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory analgesics (NSAIDs) should be used on a short-term, regular basis and not on an as needed basis. On the other hand, treatment of chronic TMD can be difficult and the condition is best managed by a team approach; the team consists of a primary care physician, a dentist, a physiotherapist, a psychologist, a pharmacologist, and in small number of cases, a surgeon. The different modalities include patient education and self-care practices, medication, physical therapy, splints, psychological counseling, relaxation techniques, biofeedback, hypnotherapy, acupuncture, and arthrocentesis.[8]
 As with most dislocated joints, a dislocated jaw can usually be successfully positioned into its normal position by a trained medical professional.  Attempts to readjust the jaw without the assistance of a medical professional could result in worsening of the injury.  The health care provider may be able to set it back into the correct position by manipulating the area back into its proper position.  Numbing medications such as general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, or in some cases sedation, may be needed to relax the strong jaw muscle.  In more severe cases, surgery may be needed to reposition the jaw, particularly if repeated jaw dislocations have occurred.[12]
 Jaw dislocation is common for people who are in car, motorcycle or related accidents and also sports related activities. This injury does not pin point specific ages or genders because it could happen to anybody.[13] People who dislocate their jaw do not usually seek emergency medical care.[13] In most cases, jaw dislocations are acute and can be altered by minor manipulations.[9][14] It was reported from one study that over a seven-year period at an emergency medical site, with 100,000 yearly visits, there were only 37 patients that were seen for a dislocated jaw.[8]

High ankle sprain,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/High_ankle_sprain,DSS," A high ankle sprain, also known as a syndesmotic ankle sprain (SAS), is a sprain of the syndesmotic ligaments that connect the tibia and fibula in the lower leg, thereby creating a mortise and tenon joint for the ankle. High ankle sprains are described as high because they are located above the ankle. They comprise approximately 15% of all ankle sprains.[1] Unlike the common lateral ankle sprains, when ligaments around the ankle are injured through an inward twisting, high ankle sprains are caused when the lower leg and foot externally rotates (twists out).
 The ankle joint consists of the talus resting within the mortise created by the tibia and fibula as previously described. Since the talus is wider anteriorly (in the front) than posteriorly (at the back), as the front of the foot is raised (dorsiflexed) reducing the angle between the foot and lower leg to less than 90°, then the mortise is confronted with an increasingly wider talus. The force is heightened when the foot is simultaneously forced into external rotation (turned outward). This chain of events may occur when the front of hockey player's skate strikes the boards and the foot is forced outward. It may also occur in football, for example, when a player is on the ground with his leg behind him, the foot at right angles, and the sudden application of a rotational force to the heel - as when someone falls on his foot. Overall, the most common mechanism is external rotation and may occur with sufficient rapidity that the actual mechanism is unrecognized.
 In this sequence of events, the most vulnerable structure is the anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament, uniting the lower end of the tibia and fibula and playing an important role in the maintenance of the mortise. The injury to this ligament may vary from simple stretch to complete rupture. Some restraint to further injury is offered by the structures on the inside of the ankle, the medial malleolus and the medial collateral ligament.  However, should these structures fail, then the force will be transmitted beyond the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament to the strong membrane that holds the tibia and fibula together for most of their length. This force may then exit through the upper end of the fibula, creating a so-called Maisonneuve fracture.[citation needed]
 Those who sustain high ankle sprains usually present with pain in the outside-front of the leg above the ankle, with increased discomfort when twisting (external rotation) is applied. In some cases, the diagnosis is only made after treatment for the more common, lateral, ankle sprain fails.[2] Diagnosis may also be delayed because swelling is usually minor or nonexistent and the true nature of the injury unappreciated.[3] A variety of diagnostic tests have been described such as the 'squeeze' (compressing the tibia and fibula above the midpoint of the calf), 'dorsiflexion with compression' (patient dorsiflexes the foot while the examiner compresses the internal and external malleolus), and 'external rotation' (patient sits with leg dangling and ankle at 90° and external rotation then applied to the foot) etc. None of them performs sufficiently well to allow diagnosis to be made on the basis of a single test,[4] and is usually made by combining multiple tests supplemented with appropriate imaging when indicated. Plain radiographs, Ultrasound[5] or MRI may be used for diagnosis.
 In the case of X-rays, demonstration of widening of the tibia and fibula 'mortise', a fracture of the medial malleolus, or a Maisonneuve fracture, will indicate an unstable or potentially unstable injury. However, 'normal' x-rays do not exclude significant ligament injury, and in one study, the ratio of diagnostic X-ray to known syndesmotic injury was only one in 17. By contrast, ultrasound may permit the injury to be visualized while the mortise is being stressed.[5] Consequently, a diagnostic modality such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)[4] that demonstrates the ligament itself may be helpful, if clinical suspicion remains.[6]
 Treatment depends on severity and convalescence may be as short as a few days or as long as six months.[7] Rest, icing, compression, and elevation is often recommended.
 Two important issues should be addressed early. First, a determination of whether the ankle is stable or unstable. This is usually answered by clinical assessment together with results of the imaging modalities previously described.  In the case of suspected instability, specialist referral is indicated as surgery and some form of internal fixation may be an option, if not a requirement.[8] Second, a decision of degree of weight bearing, if any, to be permitted. The answer to this is partly related to stability, partly to the clinical estimate of ligament injury together with imaging findings, and partly related to discomfort when weight bearing. The final decision is largely individualized depending on the circumstances.
 An alternative measure consists of H.E.M. (Healthy blood flow, Eliminate swelling and Mobility). This treatment suggests increasing healthy blood flow to the ankle, including immune cells required for healing. The treatment also suggests improving healthy range of motion, stability and strength in the ankle to aid in a full recovery. Recent research suggests that macrophages (immune cells responsible for muscle repair and growth) are necessary for muscle to grow back to its pre-injured state.[9] This requires healthy blood flow, but since it has been suggested that ""when ice is applied to a body part for a prolonged period, nearby lymphatic vessels begin to dramatically increase their permeability (lymphatic vessels are ‘dead-end’ tubes which ordinarily help carry excess tissue fluids back into the cardiovascular system). As lymphatic permeability is enhanced, large amounts of fluid begin to pour from the lymphatics ‘in the wrong direction’ (into the injured area), increasing the amount of local swelling and pressure and potentially contributing to greater pain."",[10] As a result, the H.E.M. ankle rehab treatment suggests not icing the injury, and instead, following more proactive rehab techniques for recovery.
 Rehabilitation is important. A significant percentage of these sprains also involve medial and/or lateral ankle ligament injury and slow recovery and continuing symptoms are common.[1]  However, limiting external rotation to protect healing ligaments is a primary concern and can usually be achieved by short leg casts, walking boots, and custom orthoses. The degree of permitted weight bearing can be individualized dependent on tolerance and those with less injury are able to ambulate with full weight-bearing. Nevertheless, most use crutches to reduce the burden to some extent and those with more discomfort may be limited to ""toe touch"" on the affected side for one to two weeks. Some advocate the ability to climb and descend stairs with minimal discomfort as an indication to permit full, or at least progressive, weight-bearing.[7]
Early resistance exercise minimizes muscle atrophy and weakness and a variety of exercises - elastic bands, ankle weights, heel raise exercises - may be used in conjunction with a calf stretch. In the early stages, isometric strengthening and electrical stimulation will combat muscle atrophy and developing weakness.

Hip dislocation,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Hip_dislocation,DSS," 
 A hip dislocation a disruption of the joint between the femur and pelvis.[1] Specifically it is when the ball–shaped head of the femur comes out of the cup–shaped acetabulum of the pelvis.[1] Symptoms typically include pain and an inability move the hip.[1] Complications may include avascular necrosis of the hip, injury to the sciatic nerve, or arthritis.[1]
 Dislocations are typically due to significant trauma such as a motor vehicle collision or fall from height.[1] Often there are also other associated injuries.[2][6] Diagnosis is generally confirmed by plain X-rays.[2] Hip dislocations can also occur follow a hip replacement or from a developmental abnormality known as hip dysplasia.[7]
 Efforts to prevent the condition include wearing a seat-belt.[1] Emergency treatment generally follows advanced trauma life support.[2] This is generally followed by reduction of the hip carried out under procedural sedation.[1] A CT scan is recommended following reduction to rule out complications.[8] Surgery is required if the joint cannot be reduced otherwise.[2] Often a few months are required for healing to occur.[1]
[9]
 Hip dislocations are uncommon.[5] Males are affected more often than females.[3] Traumatic dislocations occurs most commonly in those 16- to 40-year old.[4] The condition was first described in the medical press in the early 1800s.[2]
 The affected leg is virtually immovable by the person, and is usually extremely painful.[10] Dislocations are categorized as either posterior or anterior, based on the location of the head of the femur (see classification above).[11]
 Nine out of ten hip dislocations are posterior.[12] The affected limb will be in a position of flexion, adduction, and internally rotated in this case.[12] The knee and the foot will be in towards the middle of the body.[10] A sciatic nerve palsy is present in 8%-20% of cases.[12]
 In an anterior dislocation the limb is held by the person in externally rotated with mild flexion and abduction.[13] Femoral nerve palsies can be present, but are uncommon.[12]
 Dislocations of the hip typically take a high degree of force.[2] About 65% of cases are related to motor vehicle collisions, with falls and sports injuries being the cause of many of the rest.[2]
 The hip joint includes the articulation of the femoral head (of femur) and the acetabulum of the pelvis. In hip dislocation, the femoral head is dislodged from this socket. Posterior dislocation is the most prevalent, in which the femoral head lies posterior and superior to the acetabulum. This is most common when the femur is adducted and internally rotated. The opposite is true for the shoulder, where the most common dislocation occurs in the anterior and inferior directions.[14] Motor vehicle traffic collisions are responsible for almost all posterior hip dislocations.[4] The posterior side of the hip exhibits primarily hip extension, dealing with the muscles: gluteus maximus, hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), and the six deep external rotators (piriformis, obturator externus, obturator internus, gemellus superior, gemellus inferior, and quadrates femoris).[15]
 To actually dislocate a healthy hip, a great amount of force needs to be applied. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common ways that hip dislocations occur. Falls from a height, such as a ladder, can also generate enough force to dislocate a hip. In older individuals, even a slight fall could cause this type of injury. Wear and tear that the body undergoes throughout the years leads to increased incidents of hip dislocation in the older population.[16]
 Several other injuries are also associated with hip dislocation. Fractures in the pelvis and legs, and minor back or head injuries can also occur, along with a hip dislocation, that is caused by a fall or athletic of injury.
 Anterior-posterior (AP) X-rays of the pelvis, AP and lateral views of the femur (knee included) are ordered for diagnosis.[12] The size of the head of the femur is then compared across both sides of the pelvis. The affected femoral head will appear larger if the dislocation is anterior, and smaller if posterior.[13] A CT scan may also be ordered to clarify the fracture pattern.
 Posterior dislocations with an associated fracture are categorised by the Thompson and Epstein classification system,  the Stewart and Milford classification system, and the Pipkin system (when associated with femoral head fractures).[18][13]
 There is also a Thompson and Epstein classification system for anterior hip dislocations.[18][13]
 Central dislocation is an outdated term for medial displacement of the femoral head into a displaced acetabular fracture.[13] It is no longer used.
 Hip dysplasia is a condition in which a child is born with a hip problem. Hip dysplasia is when the formation of the hip joint is abnormal. The ball at the top of the thighbone which is known as the femoral head is not stable within the socket (which is also known as the acetabulum).
 Hip dysplasia is the preferred term because it provides a more accurate description of the spectrum of abnormalities that affect the immature hip.[19] The term ""congenital"" dislocation is no longer recommended, except for very rare conditions, in which there is a (""teratologic"") fixed dislocation location present at birth.[12]
 The hip should be reduced as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.[4] This is done via inline manual traction with general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, or conscious sedation.[13] Fractures of the femoral head and other loose bodies should be determined prior to reduction. Common closed reduction methods include the Allis method and Stimson method.[20] Once reduction is completed management becomes less urgent and appropriate workup including CT scanning can be completed.[13]  Post-reduction, people may begin early crutch-assisted ambulation with weight bearing as tolerated.
 If the dislocated hip cannot be reduced by manipulation alone, an immediate open (surgical) reduction is necessary. A CT scan or Judet views should be obtained prior to transfer to the surgical suite.[13]
 Hip dislocation rehabilitation can take anywhere from two to three months, depending on the person.  Complications to nearby nerves and blood vessels can sometimes cause loss of blood supply to the bone, also known as osteonecrosis.  The protective cartilage on the bone can also be disturbed from this type of injury.  For this reason, it is important for people to contact a physician and get treatment immediately following injury.[16]
 Individuals suffering from hip dislocation should participate in physical therapy and receive professional prescriptive exercises based on their individual abilities, progress, and overall range of motion. The following are some typical recommended exercises used as rehabilitation for hip dislocation. It is important to understand that each individual has different capabilities that can best be assessed by a physical therapist or medical professional, and that these are simply recommendations.[21]
 16-40 year-old males are responsible for the majority of hip dislocations. These hip dislocations are typically posterior, and a direct result of motor vehicle traffic collisions.[4]

Joint dislocation,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Joint_dislocation,DSS," 
 A joint dislocation, also called luxation, occurs when there is an abnormal separation in the joint, where two or more bones meet.[1] A partial dislocation is referred to as a subluxation. Dislocations are often caused by sudden trauma on the joint like an impact or fall. A joint dislocation can cause damage to the surrounding ligaments, tendons, muscles, and nerves.[2] Dislocations can occur in any joint major (shoulder, knees, etc.) or minor (toes, fingers, etc.).  The most common joint dislocation is a shoulder dislocation.[1]
 Treatment for joint dislocation is usually by closed reduction, that is, skilled manipulation to return the bones to their normal position. Reduction should only be performed by trained medical professionals, because it can cause injury to soft tissue and/or the nerves and vascular structures around the dislocation.[3]
 The following symptoms are common with any type of dislocation.[1]
 Joint dislocations are caused by trauma to the joint or when an individual falls on a specific joint.[4] Great and sudden force applied, by either a blow or fall, to the joint can cause the bones in the joint to be displaced or dislocated from normal position.[5] With each dislocation, the ligaments keeping the bones fixed in the correct position can be damaged or loosened, making it easier for the joint to be dislocated in the future.[6]
 Some individuals are prone to dislocations due to congenital conditions, such as hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Hypermobility syndrome is genetically inherited disorder that is thought to affect the encoding of the connective tissue protein’s collagen in the ligament of joints.[7] The loosened or stretched ligaments in the joint provide little stability and allow for the joint to be easily dislocated.[1]
 Initial evaluation of a suspected joint dislocation should begin with a thorough patient history, including mechanism of injury, and physical examination. Special attention should be focused on the neurovascular exam both before and after reduction, as injury to these structures may occur during the injury or during the reduction process.[3] Subsequent imaging studies are frequently obtained to assist with diagnosis.
 A dislocated joint usually can be successfully reduced into its normal position only by a trained medical professional. Trying to reduce a joint without any training could substantially worsen the injury.[15]
 X-rays are usually taken to confirm a diagnosis and detect any fractures which may also have occurred at the time of dislocation. A dislocation is easily seen on an X-ray.[16]
 Once a diagnosis is confirmed, the joint is usually manipulated back into position.  This can be a very painful process, therefore this is typically done either in the emergency department under sedation or in an operating room under a general anaesthetic.[17]
 It is important the joint is reduced as soon as possible, as in the state of dislocation, the blood supply to the joint (or distal anatomy) may be compromised.  This is especially true in the case of a dislocated ankle, due to the anatomy of the blood supply to the foot.[18]
 Shoulder injuries can also be surgically stabilized, depending on the severity, using arthroscopic surgery.[16] The most common treatment method for a dislocation of the Glenohumeral Joint (GH Joint/Shoulder Joint) is exercise based management.[19] Another method of treatment is to place the injured arm in a sling or in another immobilizing device in order to keep the joint stable.[20]
 Some joints are more at risk of becoming dislocated again after an initial injury.  This is due to the weakening of the muscles and ligaments which hold the joint in place.  The shoulder is a prime example of this.  Any shoulder dislocation should be followed up with thorough physiotherapy.[16]
 On field reduction is crucial for joint dislocations. As they are extremely common in sports events, managing them correctly at the game at the time of injury, can reduce long term issues. They require prompt evaluation, diagnosis, reduction, and postreduction management before the person can be evaluated at a medical facility.[20]
 After a dislocation, injured joints are usually held in place by a splint (for straight joints like fingers and toes) or a bandage (for complex joints like shoulders).  Additionally, the joint muscles, tendons and ligaments must also be strengthened. This is usually done through a course of physiotherapy, which will also help reduce the chances of repeated dislocations of the same joint.[21]
 For glenohumeral instability, the therapeutic program depends on specific characteristics of the instability pattern, severity, recurrence and direction with adaptations made based on the needs of the patient. In general, the therapeutic program should focus on restoration of strength, normalization of range of motion and optimization of flexibility and muscular performance. Throughout all stages of the rehabilitation program, it is important to take all related joints and structures into consideration.[22]

Knee dislocation,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Knee_dislocation,DSS," 
 A knee dislocation is a knee injury in which there is a complete disruption of the joint between the tibia and the femur.[3][4] Symptoms include knee pain and instability of the knee.[2] Complications may include injury to an artery around the knee, most commonly the artery behind the knee, or compartment syndrome.[3][4][7]
 About half of cases are the result of major trauma and about half occur as a result of minor trauma.[3] In about half of cases the joint reduces itself before a person arrives at the hospital.[3] Typically there is a break of the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and either the medial collateral ligament or lateral collateral ligament.[3] If the ankle–brachial pressure index is less than 0.9, CT angiography is recommended to detect blood vessel injury.[3] Otherwise repeated physical exams may be sufficient.[2]
 If the joint remains dislocated, reduction and splinting is indicated;[4] this is typically carried out under procedural sedation.[2] In those with signs of arterial injury, immediate surgery is generally carried out.[3] Multiple surgeries may be required.[4] In just over 10% of cases, an amputation of part of the leg is required.[4]
 Knee dislocations are rare, occurring in about 1 per 100,000 people per year.[3] Males are more often affected than females.[2] Younger adults are most often affected.[2] Descriptions of this injury date back to at least 20 BC by Meges of Sidon.[8]
 Symptoms include knee pain.[2] The joint may also be obviously out of place.[2] A joint effusion is not always present.[2]
 Complications may include injury to the artery behind the knee in about 20% of cases or compartment syndrome.[3][4] Damage to the common peroneal nerve or tibial nerve may also occur.[2] Nerve problems if they occur often never fully heal.[10]
 About half are the result of major trauma and about half occur as a result of minor trauma.[3] Major trauma may include mechanisms like falls from a significant height, motor vehicle collisions, or a pedestrian being hit by a motor vehicle.[2] Cases due to major trauma often have other injuries.[5]
 Minor trauma may include tripping while walking or while playing sports.[2] Risk factors include obesity.[2]
 The condition may also occur in a number of genetic disorders such as Ellis–van Creveld syndrome, Larsen syndrome, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.[11]
 As the injury may reduce on its own before a person arrives at the hospital, the diagnosis may be missed.[2] Diagnosis may be suspected based on the history of the injury and a physical examination.[5] This may include anterior drawer test, valgus stress test, varus stress test, and posterior sag test.[5] An accurate physical exam can be difficult due to pain.[5]
 Plain X-rays, CT scan, ultrasonography, or MRI may help with the diagnosis.[2][10] Findings on X-ray that may be useful among those who have already reduced include a variable joint space, subluxation of the joint, or a Segond fracture.[5]
 If the ankle–brachial pressure index (ABI) is less than 0.9, CT angiography is recommended.[3] Standard angiography may also be used.[2] If the ABI is greater than 0.9 repeated physical exams over the next 24 hours to verify good blood flow may be sufficient.[2][10] The ABI is calculated by taking the systolic blood pressure at the ankle and dividing it by the systolic blood pressure in the arm.[2]
 They may be divided into five types: anterior, posterior, lateral, medial, and rotatory.[4] This classification is based on the movement of the tibia with respect to the femur.[10] Anterior dislocations are the most common, followed by posterior dislocations.[2] They may also be classified based on what ligaments are damaged.[2]
 Initial management is often based on Advanced Trauma Life Support.[5] If the joint remains dislocated reduction and splinting is indicated.[4] Reduction can often be done with simple traction after the person has received procedural sedation.[10] If the joint cannot be reduced in the emergency department emergency surgery is recommended.[2]
 In those with signs of arterial injury immediate surgery is generally carried out.[3] If the joint does not stay reduced external fixation may be needed.[2] If the nerves and artery are intact the ligaments may be repaired after a few days.[10] Multiple surgeries may be required.[4] In just over 10% of cases an amputation of part of the leg is required.[4]
 Knee dislocations are rare: they represent about 1 in 5,000 orthopedic injuries,[5] and about 1 knee dislocation occurs annually per 100,000 people.[3]  Males are more often affected than females, and young adults are most often affected.[2]

Metatarsophalangeal joint sprain,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Metatarsophalangeal_joint_sprain,DSS," A metatarsophalangeal joint sprain is an injury to the connective tissue between the foot and one of the toes. When the big toe is involved, it is known as ""turf toe"".[1][2]
 Turf toe is named from the injury being associated with playing sports on rigid surfaces such as artificial turf[3][4] and is a fairly common injury among professional American football players.  Often, the injury occurs when someone or something falls on the back of the calf while that leg's knee and tips of the toes are touching the ground.  The toe is hyperextended and thus the joint is injured.  Additionally, athletic shoes with very flexible soles combined with cleats that ""grab"" the turf will cause overextension of the big toe. This can occur on the lesser toes as well.  It has also been observed in sports beyond American football, including soccer, basketball, rugby, volleyball, and tae kwon do.[5] This is a primary reason why many athletes prefer natural grass to turf, because it is softer.[6]
 The injury can be debilitating for athletes of many sports who need to accelerate, quickly change direction, or jump. Use of the toes is not possible during the healing process.[citation needed]  Since the toes are necessary for proper push-off when accelerating, those sorts of athletic activities should be almost completely curtailed. An extended healing period of one or more months is often required.
 Because of the anatomy of the distal foot and the unique use of the foot, it is often impossible to properly tape or brace the joint. Although difficult, it is not impossible to tape the toe to limit extension (upward bend of toe). Additionally, wearing a shoe with a rigid sole (often a metal plate) and cushioned innersole will help minimize extension of the joint. Anti-inflammatory medication as well as physical therapy is recommended.[citation needed]
 Turf toe is usually healed in about 2–3 weeks.[7] It can become more serious if left untreated, and may cause serious problems for the athlete. Treating the injury includes icing of the area, elevating the foot, or possibly the use of custom orthotics.[8]
"
Patellar dislocation,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Patellar_dislocation,DSS," 
 A patellar dislocation is a knee injury in which the patella (kneecap) slips out of its normal position.[5] Often the knee is partly bent, painful and swollen.[1][2] The patella is also often felt and seen out of place.[1] Complications may include a patella fracture or arthritis.[3]
 A patellar dislocation typically occurs when the knee is straight and the lower leg is bent outwards when twisting.[1][2] Occasionally it occurs when the knee is bent and the patella is hit.[1] Commonly associated sports include soccer, gymnastics, and ice hockey.[2] Dislocations nearly always occur away from the midline.[2] Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by X-rays.[2]
 Reduction is generally done by pushing the patella towards the midline while straightening the knee.[1] After reduction the leg is generally splinted in a straight position for a few weeks.[1] This is then followed by physical therapy.[1] Surgery after a first dislocation is generally of unclear benefit.[6][4] Surgery may be indicated in those who have broken off a piece of bone within the joint or in which the patella has dislocated multiple times.[4][5][3]
 Patellar dislocations occur in about 6 per 100,000 people per year.[4] They make up about 2% of knee injuries.[1] It is most common in those 10 to 17 years old.[4] Rates in males and females are similar.[4] Recurrence after an initial dislocation occurs in about 30% of people.[4]
 People often describe pain as being ""inside the knee cap."" The leg tends to flex even when relaxed. In some cases, the injured ligaments involved in patellar dislocation do not allow the leg to flex almost at all.[2]
 A predisposing factor is tightness in the tensor fasciae latae muscle and iliotibial tract in combination with a quadriceps imbalance between the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles can play a large role, found, mainly, in women with higher level the physical activity.[7] Moreover, women with patellofemoral pain may show increased Q-angle compared with women without patellofemoral pain.
 Another cause of patellar symptoms is lateral patellar compression syndrome, which can be caused from lack of balance or inflammation in the joints.[8] The pathophysiology of the kneecap is complex, and deals with the osseous soft tissue or abnormalities within the patellofemoral groove. The patellar symptoms cause knee extensor dysplasia, and sensitive small variations affect the muscular mechanism that controls the joint movements.[9]
 24% of people whose patellas have dislocated have relatives who have experienced patellar dislocations.[2]
 Patellar dislocation occurs in sports that involve rotating the knee.
Direct trauma to the knee can knock the patella out of joint.
 People who have larger Q angles tend to be more prone to having knee injuries such as dislocations, due to the central line of pull found in the quadriceps muscles that run from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the patella. The range of a normal Q angle for men ranges from <15 degrees and for females <20 degrees, putting females at a higher risk for this injury.[10] An angle greater than 25 degrees between the patellar tendon and quadriceps muscle can predispose a person to patellar dislocation.[11]
 In patella alta, the patella sits higher on the knee than normal.[11] Normal function of the VMO muscle stabilizes the patella. Decreased VMO function results in instability of the patella.[2]
 When there is too much tension on the patella, the ligaments will weaken and be susceptible to tearing ligaments or tendons due to shear force or torsion force, which then displaces the kneecap from its origination. Another cause that patellar dislocation can occur is when the trochlear groove that has been completely flattened is defined as trochlear dysplasia.[12] Not having a groove because the trochlear bone has flattened out can cause the patella to slide because nothing is holding the patella in place.
 Patellar dislocations occur by:
 The patella is a triangular sesamoid bone which is embedded in tendon. It rests in the patellofemoral groove, an articular cartilage-lined hollow at the end of the thigh bone (femur) where the thigh bone meets the shin bone (tibia). Several ligaments and tendons hold the patella in place and allow it to move up and down the patellofemoral groove when the leg bends. The top of the patella attaches to the quadriceps muscle via the quadriceps tendon,[2] the middle to the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscles, and the bottom to the head of the tibia (tibial tuberosity) via the patellar tendon, which is a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon.[13] The medial patellofemoral ligament attaches horizontally in the inner knee to the adductor magnus tendon and is the structure most often damaged during a patellar dislocation. Finally, the lateral collateral ligament and the medial collateral ligament stabilize the patella on either side.[2] Any of these structures can sustain damage during a patellar dislocation.
 To assess the knee, a clinician can perform the patellar apprehension test by moving the patella back and forth while the people flexes the knee at approximately 30 degrees.[14]
 The people can do the patella tracking assessment by making a single leg squat and standing, or by lying on his or her back with knee extended from flexed position. A patella that slips laterally on early flexion is called the J sign, and indicates imbalance between the VMO and lateral structures.[15]
 On X-ray, with skyline projections, dislocations are readily diagnosed. In borderline cases of subluxation, the following measurements can be helpful:
 The patella is a floating sesamoid bone held in place by the quadriceps muscle tendon and patellar tendon ligament. Exercises should strengthen quadriceps muscles such as rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis. However, tight and strong lateral quadriceps can be an underlying cause of patellar dislocation. If this is the case, it is advisable to strengthen the medial quadriceps, vastus medialis (VMO), and stretch the lateral muscles.[17] Exercises to strengthen quadriceps muscles include, but are not limited to, squats and lunges. Adding extra external support around the knee by using devices such as knee [orthotics] or athletic tape can help to prevent patellar dislocation and other knee-related injuries.[18] External supports, such as knee braces and athletic tape, work by providing movement in only the desired planes and help hinder movements that can cause abnormal movement and injuries.  Women who wear high heels tend to develop short calf muscles and tendons. Exercises to stretch and strengthen calf muscles are recommended on a daily basis.[19]
 Two types of treatment options are typically available:
 Surgery may impede normal growth of structures in the knee, so doctors generally do not recommend knee operations for young people who are still growing.[20][21]  There are also risks of complications, such as an adverse reaction to anesthesia or an infection.[20][21]
 When designing a rehabilitation program, clinicians consider associated injuries such as chipped bones or soft tissue tears. Clinicians take into account the person's age, activity level, and time needed to return to work and/or athletics. Doctors generally only recommend surgery when other structures in the knee have sustained severe damage, or specifically when there is:[20]
 Supplements like glucosamine and NSAIDs can be used to minimize bothersome symptoms.[14]
 An effective rehabilitation program reduces the chances of re-injury and of other knee-related problems such as patellofemoral pain syndrome and osteoarthritis.  Most patella dislocations are initially immobilized for the first 2–3 weeks to allow the stretched structures to heal. Rehabilitation focuses on maintaining strength and range of motion to reduce pain and maintain the health of the muscles and tissues around the knee joint.[14] The objective to any good rehabilitation program is to reduce pain, swelling and stiffness as well as increase range of motion. A common rehabilitation plan is to strengthen both the hip abductors, hip external rotators and the quadricep muscles. Commonly used exercises include isometric quadricep sets, side lying clamshells, leg dips with internal tibial rotation, etc. The idea is that because the medial side is most often stretched by the more common lateral dislocation, medial strengthening will add more stabilizing support. With progression more intense range of motion exercises are incorporated.[22]
 Rate in the United States are estimated 2.3 per 100,000 per year.[23] Rates for ages 10–17 were found to be about 29 per 100,000 persons per year, while the adult population average for this type of injury ranged between 5.8 and 7.0 per 100,000 persons per year.[24] The highest rates of patellar dislocation were found in the youngest age groups, while the rates declined with increasing ages. Females are more susceptible to patellar dislocation. Race is a significant factor for this injury, where Hispanics, African-Americans and Caucasians had slightly higher rates of patellar dislocation due to the types of athletic activity involved in: basketball (18.2%), soccer (6.9%), and football (6.9%), according to Brian Waterman.[23]
 Lateral Patellar dislocation is common among the child population. Some studies suggest that the annual patellar dislocation rate in children is 43/100,000.[25] The treatment of the skeletally immature is controversial due to the fact that they are so young and are still growing. Surgery is recommended by some experts in order to repair the medial structures early, while others recommend treating it non operatively with physical therapy. If re-dislocation occurs then reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the recommended surgical option.[26]

Patellar tendon rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Patellar_tendon_rupture,DSS," Patellar tendon rupture is a tear of the tendon that connects the knee cap (patella) to the tibia.[1] Often there is sudden onset of pain and walking is difficult.[1] In a complete rupture the ability to extend that knee is decreased.[1] A pop may be felt when it occurs.[2]
 Injury to the patellar tendon generally requires a significant force such as falling directly on the knee or jumping from a height.[1] Risk factors include patellar tendinitis, kidney failure, diabetes, and steroid or fluoroquinolone use.[1][2] There are two main types of ruptures partial and complete.[1] In most cases, the patellar tendon tears at the point where it attaches to the knee cap.[1] Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination, and medical imaging.[1]
 Small tears may be treated with rest and splinting, followed by physiotherapy.[1][2] Larger tears typically require surgery within a couple of weeks.[1][2] Outcomes are generally good.[1] Rates in the general population are not clear, however in certain high risk groups it occurs about 1 in 10,000 per year.[2] They occur most often in those under the age of 40.[2]
 The sign of a ruptured patella tendon is the movement of the patella further up the quadriceps. When rupture occurs, the patella loses support from the tibia and moves toward the hip when the quadriceps muscle contracts, hindering the leg's ability to extend. This means that those affected cannot stand, as their knee buckles and gives way when they attempt to do so.
 The upper part of the patellar tendon attaches on the lower part of the knee cap, and the lower part of the patella tendon attaches to the tibial tubercle on the front of the tibia. Above the knee cap the quadriceps muscle via the quadriceps tendon attaches to the top of the knee cap. This structure allows the knee to flex and extend, allowing use of basic functions such as walking and running.
 Patellar tendon rupture can usually be diagnosed by physical examination. The most common signs are: tenderness, the tendon's loss of tone, loss of ability to raise the straight leg and observation of the high-riding patella. Radiographically, patella alta can be detected using the Insall and Salvati method when the patella is shorter than its tendon. Partial tears may be visualized using MRI scans.[4]
 Patellar tendon rupture must be treated surgically. With a tourniquet applied, the tendon is exposed through a midline longitudinal incision extending from the upper patellar pole to the tibial tuberosity. The tendon is either avulsed (detached) from the lower patellar pole or lacerated. Even so, the continuity and tone of the tendon should be restored, taking into consideration the patellar height.
 A cast or brace is then put over where the operation took place. The cast or brace remains for at least 6 weeks followed by an unidentified time of rehabilitation of the knee.
 The usual risks of surgery are involved, including: infection, stiffness, death, suture reaction, failure of satisfactory healing, risks of anesthesia, phlebitis, pulmonary embolus, and persistent pain or weakness after the injury and repair.
 If the tendon rupture is a partial tear (without the two parts of the tendon being separated), then non-surgical methods of treatment may suffice. The future of non-surgical care for partial patella tendon ruptures is likely bioengineering. Ligament reconstruction is possible using mesenchymal stem cells and a silk scaffold.[5] These same stem cells have been shown to be capable of seeding repair of damaged animal tendons.[6] In 2010, a clinical study proved that mechanical loading of the tendon callus during the remodelling phase leads to healing by regeneration.[7]

Perthes lesion,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Perthes_lesion,DSS," Perthes lesion is variant of Bankart lesion, presenting as an anterior glenohumeral injury that occurs when the scapular periosteum remains intact but is stripped medially and the anterior labrum is avulsed from the glenoid but remains partially attached to the scapula by intact periosteum.
 The lesion is associated with any damage to the antero-inferior labrum. Most commonly due to anterior shoulder dislocation. The lesion often occurs after the initial dislocation. In chronic cases there may be fibrosis and resynovialization of the labrum and periosteum.
 The lesion is best identified on MR arthrography. Additional views in ABER (ABduction and External Rotation) of the shoulder aid in this diagnosis.
 Differential diagnoses include:
 Treatment is surgical  re-attachment of the labrum preferably via arthroscopy.
 It is named after Georg C. Perthes (1869-1927), a German Surgeon and X-Ray diagnostic pioneer who first described the lesion in 1905.

Pulled elbow,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Pulled_elbow,DSS," A pulled elbow, also known as a radial head subluxation,[4] is when the ligament that wraps around the radial head slips off.[1] Often a child will hold their arm against their body with the elbow slightly bent.[1] They will not move the arm as this results in pain.[2] Touching the arm, without moving the elbow, is usually not painful.[1]
 A pulled elbow typically results from a sudden pull on an extended arm.[2] This may occur when lifting or swinging a child by the arms.[2] The underlying mechanism involves slippage of the annular ligament off of the head of the radius followed by the ligament getting stuck between the radius and humerus.[1] Diagnosis is often based on symptoms.[2] Xrays may be done to rule out other problems.[2]
 Prevention is by avoiding potential causes.[2] Treatment is by reduction.[2] Moving the forearm into a palms down position with straightening at the elbow appears to be more effective than moving it into a palms up position followed by bending at the elbow.[1][4][5] Following a successful reduction the child should return to normal within a few minutes.[1] A pulled elbow is common.[2] It generally occurs in children between the ages of 1 and 4 years old, though it can happen up to 7 years old.[2]
 Symptoms include:
 This injury has also been reported in babies younger than six months and in older children up to the preteen years. There is a slight predilection for this injury to occur in girls and in the left arm. The classic mechanism of injury is longitudinal traction on the arm with the wrist in pronation, as occurs when the child is lifted up by the wrist. There is no support for the common assumption that a relatively small head of the radius as compared to the neck of the radius predisposes the young to this injury.[citation needed]
 The distal attachment of the annular ligament covering the radial head is weaker in children than in adults, allowing it to be more easily torn. The older child will usually point to the dorsal aspect of the proximal forearm when asked where it hurts. This may mislead one to suspect a buckle fracture of the proximal radius.[7] There is no tear in the soft tissue (probably due to the pliability of young connective tissues).[7]
 The forearm contains two bones: the radius and the ulna. These bones are attached to each other both at the proximal, or elbow, end and also at the distal, or wrist, end. Among other movements, the forearm is capable of pronation and supination, which is to say rotation about the long axis of the forearm. In this movement the ulna, which is connected to the humerus by a simple hinge-joint, remains stationary, while the radius rotates, carrying the wrist and hand with it. To allow this rotation, the proximal (elbow) end of the radius is held in proximity to the ulna by a ligament known as the annular ligament. This is a circular ligamentous structure within which the radius is free, with constraints existing elsewhere in the forearm, to rotate.The proximal end of the radius in young children is conical, with the wider end of the cone nearest the elbow. With the passage of time the shape of this bone changes, becoming more cylindrical but with the proximal end being widened.
 If the forearm of a young child is pulled, it is possible for this traction to pull the radius into the annular ligament with enough force to cause it to be jammed therein. This causes significant pain, partial limitation of flexion/extension of the elbow and total loss of pronation/supination in the affected arm. The situation is rare in adults, or in older children, because the changing shape of the radius associated with growth prevents it.
 Diagnosis is often based on symptoms.[2] X-rays may be done to rule out other problems.[2]
 To resolve the problem, the affected arm is moved in a way that causes the joint to move back into a normal position. The two main methods are hyperpronation and a combination of supination and flexion. Hyperpronation has a higher success rate and is less painful than a supination-flexion maneuver.[4][8]

Pulled hamstring,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Pulled_hamstring,DSS," Straining of the hamstring, also known as a pulled hamstring, is defined as an excessive stretch or tear of muscle fibers and related tissues.
Hamstring injuries are common in athletes participating in many sports and are very difficult to treat and rehabilitate.  Track and field athletes are particularly at risk, as hamstring injuries have been estimated to make up 29% of all injuries in sprinters.[1]
 The biceps femoris long head is at the most risk for injury, possibly due to its reduced moment of knee and hip flexion as compared to the medial hamstrings.[2]
 Sensation of cramp or tightness and a slight feeling of pain when the muscles are stretched or contracted.[citation needed]
 With a grade two hamstring strain there is immediate pain which is more severe than the pain of a grade one injury. It is confirmed by pain on stretch, swelling and contraction of the muscle.
 A grade three hamstring strain is a severe injury. There is an immediate burning or stabbing pain and the individual is unable to walk without pain. The muscle is completely torn and there may be a large lump of muscle tissue above a depression where the tear is.
 After a few days with grade two and three injuries a large bruise may appear below the injury site caused by the bleeding within the tissues.
 Recommended treatment for this injury consists of the RICE protocol — rest, ice, compression and elevation.[3] The RICE method is primarily used to reduce bleeding and damage within the muscle tissue. Lower grade strains can easily become worse if the hamstring is not rested properly. Complete ruptures require surgical repair and rehabilitation.
 Initial treatment of the injury, regardless of the severity of the strain, is the same. Within the first five days, the hamstring is rested in an elevated position with an ice pack applied for twenty minutes every two hours. A compression bandage is applied to limit bleeding and swelling in the tissues. After five days of rest, active rehabilitation begins.
 An academic study found that the most common and prevalent muscluoskeletal injury in the world is a hamstring strain.[4] The study further explains that hamstring strains represented 15% of all injuries per club per season also had a 34% chance of recurrence.[4] Another study showed that a previous hamstring injury is one of the most cited risks for future injury, with as many as one-third of active individuals experiencing a re-injury within 2 weeks of returning to activity.[5]
A meta-analysis article showed evidence that a history of hamstring injury and being of older age were associated with increased risk of hamstring strains.[6] One study found that men and master athletes (athletes older than forty) were at an increased risk of hamstring strains compared with women and younger athletes.[7] Women were approximately 3 times more likely to suffer hamstring strain than males with the majority of these being non-sporting scenarios.[8] Similarly the average age of non-sporting hamstring strains are from the ages of 40-60.[8] Many of these non-sporting injuries are sustained during road traffic accidents, slipping, and falling.[8] These results also show that hamstring strains account for 50% of muscle injuries received by sprinters and are the most common injury in hurdling.[9] One explanation is that older active individuals may be at greater risk due to lower levels of eccentric knee flexor strength compared with their younger counterparts.[7] However, it is unclear whether flexibility serves as a risk factor; this topic should be researched in the future to further understand the relationship between flexibility and risk of injury.[10] Muscle weakness has also been an implication as a predisposing factor for both primary and recurring hamstring strain injuries.[11] Over a 10-year study more than 51.3% of hamstring strains occurred during the preseason of athletics.[11] In another study, that analyzed 25 NCAA sports over four years, it was clearly shown that hamstring strain rates are higher in the preseason.[10] The factors that are being implicated in this trend are the relative deterioration and muscle weakness that occur during the off-season.[9]
 The hamstrings undergo a complex dynamic process during gait, making it unsurprising that they are frequently injured.  They must first contract concentrically during the end of the stance phase in order to bend the knee and allow the foot (along with dorsiflexion at the ankle) to clear the ground.  At the end of the swing phase the hamstrings must eccentrically contract while applying a braking moment to knee extension, then immediately change functions to again concentrically contract and produce hip extension.  Studies have shown that “the hamstring group reaches peak elongation and acts eccentrically at the hip and knee during the late swing phases of running”[12] and that “the hamstrings are most active and develop the greatest torques at the hip and knee during the late swing through midstance phase of running.”[12]  Thus, the hamstrings reach their maximum length while attempting to forcefully contract eccentrically and switch functions to immediately produce a concentric contraction, which makes the terminal part of swing phase the most vulnerable for injury.
 There have been many other proposed predisposing factors to injury.  These include muscle weakness, muscle imbalance, poor flexibility, fatigue, inadequate warm up, poor neuromuscular control, and poor running technique.[12] One of the few predisposing factors that most researchers agree upon however is previous hamstring injury.  Brokett et al. (2004) [13] stated that “the athletes most at risk of a hamstring strain are those with a previous history of such injury” and noted that 34% of the hamstring injuries were recurrences.”  Cameron et al. also found that 34% of injuries recur in the same season.  Arnason et al.[1] generalized these numbers, saying that previous injury was in itself an independent risk factor for re-injury.

Quadriceps tendon rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Quadriceps_tendon_rupture,DSS," A quadriceps tendon rupture is a tear of the tendon that runs from the quadriceps muscle to the top of the knee cap.[1]
 Symptoms are pain and the inability to extend the knee against resistance. A gap can often be palpated at the tendon's normal location.
 The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but ultrasound or MRI can be used if there is any doubt.

Separated shoulder,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Separated_shoulder,DSS," A separated shoulder, also known as acromioclavicular joint injury, is a common injury to the acromioclavicular joint.[2] The AC joint is located at the outer end of the clavicle where it attaches to the acromion of the scapula.[2] Symptoms include pain which may make it difficult to move the shoulder and often a deformity.[2][1]
 It is most commonly due to a fall onto the front and upper part of the shoulder when the arm is by the side.[2] They are classified as type I, II, III, IV, V, or VI with the higher the number the more severe the injury.[2] Diagnosis is typically based on physical examination and X-rays.[2] In type I and II injuries there is minimal deformity while in a type III injury the deformity resolves upon lifting the arm upwards.[2] In type IV, V, and VI the deformity does not resolve with lifting the arm.[2]
 Generally types I and II are treated without surgery, while type III may be treated with or without surgery, and types IV, V, and VI are treated with surgery.[3] For type I and II treatment is usually with a sling and pain medications for a week or two.[2] In type III injuries surgery is generally only done if symptoms remain following treatment without surgery.[2]
 A separated shoulder is a common injury among those involved in sports, especially contact sports.[3] It makes up about half of shoulder injuries among those who play hockey, football, and rugby.[1] Those affected are typically 20 to 30 years old.[3] Males are more often affected than females.[3] The injury was initially classified in 1967 with the current classification from 1984.[1]
 Separated shoulders often occur in people who participate in sports such as football, soccer, horseback riding, hockey, lacrosse, parkour, combat sports, rowing, rugby, snowboarding, skateboarding, crack the whip, cycling,  roller derby and wrestling. The separation is classified into 6 types, with 1 through 3 increasing in severity, and 4 through 6 being the most severe. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on the tip of the shoulder or also a fall on an outstretched hand. In falls where the force is transmitted indirectly, often only the acromioclavicular ligament is affected, and the coracoclavicular ligaments remain unharmed.[5]  In ice hockey, the separation is sometimes due to a lateral force, as when one gets forcefully checked into the side of the rink.[6]
 The acromion of the scapula is connected to the clavicle by the superior acromioclavicular ligament. The coracoclavicular ligaments connect the clavicle to the coracoid process. The two ligaments that form the coracoclavicular ligaments are the trapezoid and conoid ligaments. These three ligaments add support to the shoulder joint.
 There are four types of soft tissue disruptions that may cause acromioclavicular separation:
 Diagnosis is based on physical examination and an x-ray. A physical examination can identify point tenderness, pain at the AC joint with cross-arm adduction, and pain relief with an injection of a local anesthetic. The cross-arm adduction will produce pain specifically at the AC joint and will be done by elevating the arm to a 90° angle, flexing the elbow to a 90° angle, and adducting the arm across the chest. The pain in the shoulder is hard to pinpoint of the innervation of the AC joint and the glenohumeral joint. An injury to the AC joint will result in pain over the AC joint, in the anterolateral neck and in the region in the anterolateral deltoid.
 X-ray indicates a separated shoulder when the acromioclavicular joint space is widened (it is normally 5 to 8 mm).[7]
 It can be classified into 6 types.
 A Type I AC separation involves direct trauma to the shoulder causing the injury to ligaments that form the joint, but no severe tearing or fracture. It is commonly referred to as a sprain.[8]
 A Type II AC separation involves complete tearing of the acromioclavicular ligament, as well as a partial tear of the coracoclavicular ligaments. This often causes a noticeable bump on the shoulder.[9]  This bump is permanent. The clavicle is unstable to direct stress examination. On radiographs, the lateral end of the clavicle may be slightly elevated by pressing on the sternal aspect of the clavicle forcing the acromial end down, and by releasing, it may pop back up eliciting a piano key sign due to the tearing of the AC. Severe pain and loss of movement are common.
 In a Type III AC separation both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn without significant disruption of the deltoid or trapezial fascia.[9] A significant bump, resulting in some shoulder deformity, is formed by the lateral end of the clavicle. This bump, caused by the clavicle's dislocation, is permanent.  The clavicle can be moved in and out of place on the shoulder. A radiographic examination, will show the results as abnormal. Pain with motion can be severe.
 This is a type III injury with avulsion of the coracoclavicular ligament from the clavicle, with the distal clavicle displaced posteriorly into or through the trapezius and may tent the posterior skin.[9] A displaced clavicle is easily seen on a radiograph. It is important to evaluate the sternoclavicular joint also, because there can be an anterior dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint and posterior dislocation of the AC joint. This injury is generally acknowledged to require surgery.
 This is a more severe form of a type III injury, with the trapezial and deltoid fascia stripped off of the acromion as well as the clavicle. This is type III but with exaggeration of the vertical displacement of the clavicle from the scapula. Distinguishing between Type III and Type V separations based on radiographs is difficult and often unreliable between surgeons.[10]  Type V is manifested by a 2- to 3-fold increase in the coracoclavicular distance.[9] The shoulder manifests as a severe droop, secondary to downward displacement of the scapula and humerus due to loss of the clavicular strut.[9] This injury generally requires surgery.
 This is type III with inferior dislocation of the distal end of the clavicle below the coracoid. This injury is associated with severe trauma and frequently accompanied by multiple other injuries.[9] The mechanism is thought to be severe hyperabduction and external rotation of the arm, combined with retraction of the scapula. The distal clavicle is found in 2 orientations, either subacromial or subcoracoid. With the subcoracoid dislocation, the clavicle becomes lodged behind the intact conjoined tendon. The posterior superior AC ligaments, which often remains attached to the acromion, get displaced into the AC interval, making anatomic reduction difficult. The tissue needs to be surgically cleared and then reattached after reduction. Most patients with type VI injuries have paresthesia that resolves after relocation of the clavicle [9] It is extremely rare and generally only involved with motor vehicle collisions. This requires surgery.
 Classification type 1 is the most common type
 Classification type 2
 Classification type 3
 Classification type 4
 Classification type 5 is rare
 Classification type 6 is rare
 Treatment of a separated shoulder depends on the severity of the injury. When beginning treatment, the first steps should be to control inflammation, and to rest and ice the joint. Anti-inflammatories such as Advil or Motrin may also relieve pain and inflammation. The joint should be iced every four hours for fifteen minutes at a time. One can wear a sling until the pain subsides; then simple exercises can be started.
 Type I and type II shoulder separation are the most common types of separated and rarely need surgery. However, the risk of arthritis with type II separations is greatly increased.  If it becomes severe, the Mumford procedure or distal clavicle excision can be performed.
 Most non-surgical treatment options include physical therapy to build up the muscles and help stabilize the joint. Literature regarding long-term follow-up after surgical repair of type III injuries is scarce, and those treated nonoperatively generally do quite well.[11]
Many studies[12][13][14][15][16] 
have come to the conclusion that non-surgical treatment is as good as or better than surgical treatment, or that anything attained because of surgery is quite limited.[16]  It appears that after a while, the body ""remodels"" the joint, either expanding the distal clavicle or causing it to atrophy.[17] There may also be the potential that surgical repair may be less painful in the long run.
 Once the pain has eased, range-of-motion exercises can be started followed by a strength training program. The strength training will include strengthening of the rotator cuff, and shoulder blade muscles. With most cases the pain goes away after three weeks. Although full recovery can take up to six weeks for type II and up to twelve weeks for type III.
 Those who do have a separated shoulder will most often return to having full function, although some may have continued pain in the area of the AC joint. With the continued pain there are some things that maybe causing it. It may be due to an abnormal contact between the bone ends when the joint is in motion, the development of arthritis, or an injury to a piece of the cushioning cartilage that is found between the bone ends of this joint.[18]
 Type IV, V, and VI shoulder separations are very uncommon but always require surgery. There is some debate among orthopedic surgeons, however, about the treatment of type III shoulder separation. Many with type III shoulder separation who do not undergo surgical treatment recover just as well as those who do receive it, and avoid the added risks that surgery may present.  Those who opt out of surgery also have faster recovery times and are able to return to work or sports sooner.  Some studies suggest early surgical treatment of type III separation may benefit laborers and athletes who perform overhead motions.  The potential benefit of surgical treatment for type III remains unproven.
 There have been many surgeries described to fix complete acromioclavicular separations, including recently arthroscopic.   There is no consensus on which surgery is best.  Several surgeries have been described with pins or hooks. Another surgery performs muscle transfer.
 A common surgery is some form of Modified Weaver-Dunn procedure, which involves cutting off the end of the clavicle portion, partially sacrificing the coracoacromial ligament and suturing the displaced acromial end to the lateral aspect of the clavicle for stabilization, then often some form of additional support is introduced to replace the coracoclavicular ligament(s).  Variations of this support includes grafting of tendons from the leg.[19] or the use of synthetic sutures or suture anchors[20] Other surgeries have used a Rockwood screw that is inserted initially and then removed after 12 weeks. Physical therapy is always recommended after surgery, and most patients get flexibility back, although possibly somewhat limited.
 After one does have surgery, a sling should be worn to support and protect the shoulder for a few days. For the first couple physical therapy visits, the treatment will focus on controlling the pain and swelling. Type of treatment can include, ice and electrical stimulation, massage, or other hand on treatment to help ease the pain and muscle spasm. After about four weeks range of motion exercises can be started. Passive exercises are done which the shoulder joint is moved but the muscles stay relaxed. After about six to eight weeks active therapy is started. Such exercises can include isometric strengthening which works the muscles without straining the healing of the joint. After about three months, more active strengthening will be incorporated which focus on improving the strength and control of the rotator cuff muscles and the muscles around the shoulder blade. The exercises that the therapist gives the patient to be done at home should be done to be able to get a better recovery in the long run.[21]

 Some physical therapy exercises that can be performed to help rehab the shoulder are:
While standing and using a theraband you can perform 
Y, T, and I’s,  
Internal shoulder rotation,  
External shoulder rotation,  
Shoulder extensions, and 
Scapula squeezes 
While lying on your side you can perform internal rotation and external rotation with a light weight. The light weight can be any type of object such as a 1-5 lb dumbbell weight, or a soup can. Also you can foam roll the pectorals. With the foam roller you can also lie on your back on top of it and do snow angels.

Shin splints,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Shin_splints,DSS," Shin splints are defined as pain along the inside edge of the shinbone (tibia).[1] Generally this is between the middle of the lower leg to the ankle.[2] The pain may be dull or sharp and is generally brought on by exercise.[1] It generally resolves during periods of rest.[3] Complications may include stress fractures.[2]
 Shin splints typically occur due to excessive physical activity.[1] Groups that are commonly affected include runners, dancers, and military personal.[2] The underlying mechanism is not entirely clear.[2] Diagnosis is generally based on the symptoms, with medical imaging done to rule out other possible causes.[2]
 Treatment is generally by rest with gradual return to exercise.[1][2] Other measures such as NSAIDs, cold packs, physical therapy, and compression may be used.[1][2] Shoe insoles may help some people.[1] Surgery is rarely required, but may be done if other measures are not effective.[2] Rates of shin splints in at risk groups are 4 to 35%.[2] It occurs more often in women.[2] It was first described in 1958.[2]
 Shin splint pain is described as a recurring dull ache along the inner part of the lower two-thirds of the tibia.[4] In contrast, stress fracture pain is localized to the fracture site.[5]
 The pain has been described as a dull ache to an intense pain that increases during exercise, and some individuals experience swelling in the pain area.[6]
 Females are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to progress to stress fractures from shin splints.[7][8]
[9] This is due in part to females having a higher incidence of diminished bone density and osteoporosis.
 Shin splints typically occur due to excessive physical activity.[1] Groups that are commonly affected include runners, dancers, and military personal.[2]
 Risk factors for developing shin splints include:
 People who have previously had shin splints are more likely to have it again.[11]
 While the exact mechanism is unknown, shin splints can be attributed to the overloading of the lower leg due to biomechanical irregularities resulting in an increase in stress exerted on the tibia. A sudden increase in intensity or frequency in activity level fatigues muscles too quickly to properly help shock absorption, forcing the tibia to absorb most of the impact. This stress is associated with the onset of shin splints.[12] Muscle imbalance, including weak core muscles, inflexibility and tightness of lower leg muscles, including the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantar muscles (commonly the flexor digitorum longus) can increase the possibility of shin splints.[13] The pain associated with shin splints is caused from a disruption of Sharpey's fibres that connect the medial soleus fascia through the periosteum of the tibia where it inserts into the bone.[12] With repetitive stress, the impact forces eccentrically fatigue the soleus and create repeated tibial bending or bowing, contributing to shin splints. The impact is made worse by running uphill, downhill, on uneven terrain, or on hard surfaces. Improper footwear, including worn-out shoes, can also contribute to shin splints.[14][15]
 Shin splints are generally diagnosed from a history and physical examination.[3] The important factors on history are the location of pain, what triggers the pain, and the absence of cramping or numbness.[3]
 On physical examination gentle pressure over the tibia should recreate the type of pain experienced.[11][16] Generally more than a 5 cm length of tibia should be involved.[11] There should be no significant swelling, redness, or poor pulses.[3]
 Other potential causes include stress fractures, compartment syndrome, nerve entrapment, and popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.[16] If the cause is unclear medical imaging such as a bone scan or MRI may be performed.[3] Bone scans and MRI can differentiate between stress fractures and shin splints.[11]
 Treatments include rest, ice and gradually returning to activity.[13] Rest and ice work to allow the tibia to recover from sudden, high levels of stress and reduce inflammation and pain levels. It is important to significantly reduce any pain or swelling before returning to activity. Strengthening exercises should be performed after pain has subsided, on calves, quadriceps and gluteals.[13] Cross training is recommended in order to maintain aerobic fitness e.g. cycling, swimming, boxing etc.[17] Individuals should gradually return to activity, beginning with a short and low intensity level. Over multiple weeks, they can slowly work up to normal activity level. It is important to decrease activity level if any pain returns. Individuals should consider running on other surfaces besides asphalt, such as grass, to decrease the amount of force the lower leg must absorb.[7] Orthoses and insoles help to offset biomechanical irregularities, like pronation, and help to support the arch of the foot.[18] Other conservative interventions include footwear refitting, orthotics, manual therapy, balance training (e.g. using a balance board), cortisone injections, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation.[13]
 Less common forms of treatment for more severe cases of shin splints include extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and surgery.[19] Surgery is only performed in extreme cases where more conservative options have been tried for at least a year.[20] However, surgery does not guarantee 100% recovery.
 Rates of shin splints in at risk groups are 4 to 35%.[2] Women are affected more often than men.[21]

SLAP tear,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/SLAP_tear,DSS," A SLAP tear or SLAP lesion is an injury to the glenoid labrum (fibrocartilaginous rim attached around the margin of the glenoid cavity). SLAP is an acronym for ""superior labral tear from anterior to posterior"".
 Several symptoms are common but not specific:[1]
 The shoulder joint is a ""ball-and-socket"" joint.[2] However, the 'socket' (the glenoid fossa of the scapula) is small, covering at most only a third of the 'ball' (the head of the humerus). It is deepened by a circumferential rim of fibrocartilage, the glenoidal labrum. Previously there was debate as to whether the labrum was fibrocartilaginous as opposed to hyaline cartilage found in the remainder of the glenoid fossa.  Previously, it was considered a redundant, evolutionary remnant, but is now considered integral to shoulder stability. Most agree that the proximal tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle becomes fibrocartilaginous prior to attaching to the superior aspect of the glenoid. The long head of the triceps brachii inserts inferiorly, similarly.[3] Together, all of those cartilaginous extensions are termed the 'glenoid labrum'.
 A SLAP tear or lesion occurs when there is damage to the superior (uppermost) area of the labrum.
These lesions have come into public awareness because of their frequency in athletes involved in overhead and throwing activities in turn relating to relatively recent description of labral injuries in throwing athletes,[4] and initial definitions of the 4 (major) SLAP sub-types,[5] 
all happening since the 1990s. The identification and treatment of these injuries continues to evolve.
 Twelve varieties of SLAP lesion have been described, with initial diagnosis by MRI or arthrography and confirmation by direct arthroscopy.[6]
 There is evidence in literature to support both surgical and non-surgical forms of treatment.[7] In some, physical therapy can strengthen the supporting muscles in the shoulder joint to the point of reestablishing stability.[citation needed]
 Surgical treatment of SLAP tears has become more common in recent years. The success rate for repairing isolated SLAP tears is reported between 74-94%.[7] While surgery can be performed as a traditional open procedure, an arthroscopic technique[8] is currently favored being less intrusive with low chance of iatrogenic infection.[9]
  Associated findings within the shoulder joint are varied, may not be predictable and include:
 Although good outcomes with SLAP repair over the age of 40 are reported, both age greater than 40 and Workmen's Compensation status have been noted as independent predictors of surgical complications. This is particularly so if there is an associated rotator cuff injury. In such circumstances, it is suggested that labral debridement and biceps tenotomy is preferred.[11]
 SLAP (Superior Labral Tear, Anterior to Posterior)
 Following inspection and determination of the extent of injury, the basic labrum repair is as follows.
 Surgical rehabilitation is vital, progressive and supervised. The first phase focuses on early motion and usually occupies post-surgical weeks one through three. Passive range of motion is restored in the shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist joints. However, while manual resistance exercises for scapular protraction, elbow extension, and pronation and supination are encouraged, elbow flexion resistance is avoided because of the biceps contraction that it generates and the need to protect the labral repair for at least six weeks. A  sling may be worn, as needed, for comfort.
Phase 2, occupying weeks 4 through 6, involves progression of strength and range of motion, attempting to achieve progressive abduction and external rotation in the shoulder joint.
Phase 3, usually weeks 6 through 10, permits elbow flexion resistive exercises, now allowing the biceps to come into play on the assumption that the labrum will have healed sufficiently to avoid injury.
Thereafter, isokinetic exercises may be commenced from weeks 10 through 12 to 16, for advanced strengthening leading to return to full activity based on post surgical evaluation, strength, and functional range of motion. The periods of isokinetics through final clearance are sometimes referred to as phases four and five.[12]
"
Sprain,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Sprain,DSS," A sprain, also known as a torn ligament, is damage to one or more ligaments in a joint, often caused by trauma or the joint being taken beyond its functional range of motion.  The severity of sprain ranges from a minor injury which resolves in a few days to a major rupture of one or more ligaments requiring surgical fixation and a period of immobilization. Sprains can occur in any joint but are most common in the ankle and wrist.[1]
 Sprains typically occur when the joint is taken beyond its functional range of motion.
 There are certain factors which increase risk of sprains. Fatigue of muscles generally leads to sprains. When one suddenly starts to exercise after a sedentary lifestyle, sprains are quite common.
While scientific studies are lacking, it is often thought that not 'warming up' is a common cause of sprains in athletes[citation needed]. 'Warming up' is thought to loosen the joint, increasing blood flow and making the joint more flexible[citation needed].
 A diagnosis of a sprain can often be made with a good degree of certainty by physical examination based on the clinical presentation and method of injury.  In some cases,  X-rays are obtained to ensure that there is no fracture. In some cases, particularly if the injury is prolonged or does not appear to be resolving as expected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed to look at surrounding soft tissues and the ligament.[2]
 Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:
 The first modality for a sprain can be remembered using the acronym RICE.[4] The treatment of sprains depends on the extent of injury and the joint involved. Medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve pain. Topical NSAIDs appear to be as good as those taken by mouth.[5] Research suggest PRICE, as a way of managing an ankle sprain.[6]
 Non operative treatments including continuous passive motion (a machine that puts the joint through range of motion) combined with a cryocuff, which applies cold and compression, are successful in reducing swelling and improving range of motion.[9] Strength and functional training that is implemented as soon as the edema subsides also aids in increasing range of motion of the joint.[9]
 Ice and compression (cold compression therapy) will not completely stop swelling and pain, but will help to minimize them as the sprain begins to heal itself.  Careful management of swelling is critical to the healing process as additional fluid may pool in the sprained area.
 The joint should be exercised again fairly soon, in milder cases from 1 to 3 days after injury.[10] Special exercises are sometimes needed in order to regain strength and help reduce the risk of ongoing problems. The joint may need to be supported by taping or bracing, helping protect it from re-injury.[10]
 Prolonged immobilization delays the healing of a sprain, as it usually leads to muscle atrophy and weakness. Mobilizing the limb soon after a sprain has been shown to promote healing by stimulating growth factors in musculoskeletal tissues linked to cellular multiplication and matrix remodeling.[11] The components of an effective rehabilitation program for all sprain injuries include increasing range of motion and progressive muscle strengthening exercise.[citation needed]
 Although prolonged immobilization can  have a negative effect on recovery, recent studies suggest that the use of a brace can improve healing by alleviating pain and stabilizing the injury, which helps prevent further damage to the ligament.[12] When using a brace, it is very important to apply the correct amount of pressure, as too much can cause complications.[12]
"
Sprained ankle,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Sprained_ankle,DSS," A sprained ankle, also known as a twisted ankle, or rolled ankle is an injury where sprain occurs on one or more ligaments of the ankle.
 Knowing the symptoms that can be experienced with a sprain is important in determining that the injury is not really a break in the bone. When a sprain occurs, broken blood vessels will hemorrhage into the tissue that surrounds the joint, causing a visible bruise. White blood cells responsible for inflammation migrate to the area, and blood flow increases as well.[1] Along with this inflammation, swelling and pain is experienced. The nerves in the area become more sensitive when the injury is suffered, so pain is felt as throbbing and will worsen if there is pressure placed on the area. Warmth and redness are also seen as blood flow is increased. Also there is a decreased ability to move the joint.
 Right foot, housed in an air brace, has become swollen as a result of a more severe 2nd degree sprain to the ankle.
 Right foot. A light 2nd degree sprain, two days after injury.
 Right foot, 3rd degree sprain. One day after injury.
 Movements - especially turning, and rolling of the foot - are the primary cause of an ankle sprain.[2]
 The risk of a sprain is greatest during activities that involve explosive side-to-side motion, such as squash, tennis, or basketball. Sprained ankles can also occur during normal daily activities such as stepping off a curb or slipping on ice.
Returning to activity before the ligaments have fully healed may cause them to heal in a stretched position, resulting in less stability at the ankle joint.  This can lead to a condition known as Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI), and an increased risk of ankle sprains.
 The following factors can contribute to an increased risk of ankle sprains:
 Ankle sprains occur usually through excessive stress on the ligaments of the ankle. This can be caused by excessive external rotation, inversion or eversion of the foot caused by an external force.  When the foot is moved past its range of motion, the excess stress puts a strain on the ligaments. If the strain is great enough to the ligaments past the yield point, then the ligament becomes damaged, or sprained.[3][4]
 The diagnosis of a sprain relies on the medical history, including symptoms, as well as making a differential diagnosis, mainly in distinguishing it from strains or bone fractures. The Ottawa ankle rule is a simple, widely used rule to help differentiate fractures of the ankle or mid-foot from other ankle injuries that do not require x-ray radiography.  It has a sensitivity of nearly 100%, meaning that a patient who tests negative, according to the rule almost certainly does not have an ankle fracture.[5]
 Ankle sprains are classified grade 1, 2, and 3.[6]
Depending on the amount of damage or the number of ligaments that are damaged, each sprain is classified from mild to severe. A grade 1 sprain is defined as mild damage to a ligament or ligaments without instability of the affected joint. A grade 2 sprain is considered a partial tear to the ligament, in which it is stretched to the point that it becomes loose. A grade 3 sprain is a complete tear of a ligament, causing instability in the affected joint.[7] Bruising may occur around the ankle.[8]
 The most common type of ankle sprain occurs when the foot is inverted too much, affecting the lateral side of the foot. When this type of ankle sprain happens, the outer, or lateral, ligaments are stretched too much. The anterior talofibular ligament is one of the most commonly involved ligaments in this type of sprain. Approximately 70-85% of ankle sprains are inversion injuries.
  When the ankle becomes inverted, the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments are damaged. This is the most common ankle sprain.
 A less common type of ankle sprain is called an eversion injury, affecting the medial side of the foot.  This happens when the foot, instead of the ankle rotating medially resulting in an inversion (the foot being rolling to the inside), the ankle rotates laterally resulting in an eversion (when the foot rolls to the outside). When this occurs, the medial, or deltoid, ligament is stretched too much.
 A high ankle sprain is an injury to the large ligaments above the ankle that join together the two long bones of the lower leg, called the tibia and fibula. High ankle sprains commonly occur from a sudden and forceful outward twisting of the foot, which commonly occurs in contact and cutting sports such as football, rugby, ice hockey, roller derby, basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, softball, baseball, track, ultimate frisbee, soccer, tennis and badminton and horse riding.
 Initial treatment commonly consists of rest, icing, compression and elevation (which is often referred to by the mnemonic RICE or sometimes PRICE with P being ""protection""). These elements have been recommended by physicians for decades for the treatment of soft tissue damage, and sprained ankles, one of the most common soft tissue injuries. RICE helps limit the amount of swelling to the area, and ""facilitates venous and lymphatic drainage"".[9] While nearly universally accepted as a treatment, there is insufficient evidence to determine its relative effectiveness as therapy for acute ankle sprains in adults,[10] and the National Athletic Trainers Association notes that most of the rationale for using RICE or individual components is based largely on low-quality clinical trials and laboratory studies with uninjured participants or animal models[11]
 Ice is often used to reduce swelling in cycles of 15–20 minutes on and 20–30 minutes off. Icing an ankle too long can cause cold injuries, indicated if the area turns white.[12] Also, it is often recommended that ice not be applied directly to the skin, but should have a thin buffer between the ice and the affected area, and some professionals think ice need not be applied at all. Recently, Gabe Mirkin, MD, who coined and popularized the acronym RICE in his The Sports Medicine Book in 1978, now has some issues with the ""i"" in RICE. After reviewing modern studies, he notes that because ice closes off the blood vessels, ""ice doesn’t increase healing—it delays it."" and now advises skipping ice altogether unless needed to reduce pain from swelling.[13] Still, it is widely accepted and, although the clinical evidence is sparse, cryotherapy (ice) has been a mainstay of clinical practice for rehabilitation specialists.
 In uncomplicated lateral ankle sprains, swelling of the soft tissue can be prevented with compression around both malleoli, elevation of the injured ankle higher than the heart, and pain-free exercises.[14]
 An orthopedic walking boot is often used for the treatment of a sprained ankle injury. Braces and crutches are also used to help alleviate the pain so the injured ankle can heal as quickly and painlessly as possible.
 Although found to be less effective than casts, compression bandages are used to provide support and compression for sprained ankles. Wrapping is started at the ball of the foot and slowly continued up to the base of the calf muscle, which pushes the swelling up toward the center of the body so that it does not gather in the foot.
 Many different types of rehabilitation exercises can be done to aid an ankle sprain regardless of the severity of the injury. The purpose of rehabilitation gives the ability for the ankle to regain strength and flexibility. A sprained ankle becomes swollen due to the increased amount of edema within the tissue, since this physiological effect is the foundation of the pain the decline of edema is the main goal during the beginning of rehabilitation.[15] This can be done instantly by implementing the RICE mechanism which is resting the ankle, applying ice, compressing, and elevating it.[9]  The emphasis of the first week of rehabilitation should be on protecting the ankle to avoid further damage. As the healing progresses, stress can be applied by different mechanisms until the ankle is fully recovered.[16] The key to a fast recovery is to implement all the different types of ankle sprain exercises so that the range of motion will increase while the pain is decreasing.[17]
 In cases where the ankle does not heal in an appropriate amount of time, other exercises need to be implemented so that strength and flexibility can be regained. Physical therapists assign different types of ankle sprain exercises that deal with ankle flexibility, strengthening, balance, and agility. If an ankle sprain does not heal properly, the joint may become unstable and may lead to chronic pain.[18] Receiving proper treatment and performing exercises that promote ankle function is important to strengthen the ankle and prevent further injury.
 A short period of immobilization in a below-knee cast or in an Aircast leads to a faster recovery at 3 months compared to a tubular compression bandage.[19] In contrast, a randomized controlled trial has concluded that appropriate exercise immediately after a sprain improves function and recovery.[20] These exercises were focused on increasing ankle range of movement, activation and strengthening of ankle musculature, and restoring normal sensorimotor control, and were carried out for 20 minutes, three times a day.[20]
After the injury, it is advisable not to walk for a couple of days. Bed rest will help to accelerate the healing process and eliminate the chance of mishandling the affected limb. Driving vehicles or operating machinery should not be attempted.
 The amount of therapy that a person can handle will depend on their level of pain and the grade of sprain they experienced. It is not recommended to return to sports or extreme physical activities until hopping on the ankle is possible without pain. Wearing high-top tennis shoes may also help prevent ankle sprains if the shoes used are laced snugly and if the ankle is taped with a wide, nonelastic adhesive tape.[21]
 For acute ankle sprains, manual joint mobilization/manipulation of the ankle has been found to diminish pain and increase range of motion. For treatment of subacute/chronic lateral ankle sprains, these techniques improved ankle range-of-motion, decreased pain and improved function.[22]
 To prevent sprains or re-injury from occurring, strengthening and stretching exercises should be done through a full range of ankle motion. To improve ankle mobility, ankle circles can be performed by extending the legs in front of the body and then moving the foot up and down, side to side, or rotating the foot in a circle. Another common exercise to improve mobility as well as proprioception is to use the toes to draw the letters of the alphabet in the air. Most importantly, the lateral aspect of the ankle joint should be strengthened with eversion exercises (i.e., underside of the foot is turned outward against resistance) to improve lateral ankle stability.[23] Stretching is also an important component of a strengthening program, to help maintain joint flexibility.
 Balance and stability training are especially important to retrain the ankle muscles to work together to support the joint.[24] This includes exercises that are performed by standing on one foot and using the injured ankle to lift the body onto its toes. To further enhance balance and stability, exercise devices such as the wobble board can be used, progressing from double-leg to single-leg stance, first with eyes open and then with eyes closed, for enhanced effectiveness.
 An example of a flexibility exercise is a towel stretch [25] and writing the alphabet with toes which will increase the range of motion.
 Ankle strengthening exercises are step ups and walking on toes which will strengthen the muscles around the swollen area.
 Balance exercises include the use of a balance board, which helps the whole body function to maintain balance.  The use of balance boards has been shown to produce significantly positive results in gaining proper balance.[26]
 Plyometrics exercises such as squat jumps and power skipping should not be implemented until the ankle has regained full agility.
 Other strategies that can be used to prevent ankle injury include:
 Most people improve significantly in the first two weeks.  However, some still have problems with pain and instability after one year (5–30%).  Re-injury is also very common.[27]
 Ankle sprains can occur through either sports or activities of daily living, and individuals can be at higher or lower risk depending on a variety of circumstances including their homeland, race, age, sex, or profession.[28]  In addition, there are different types of ankle sprains such as eversion ankle sprains and inversion ankle sprains.  Overall, the most common type of ankle sprain to occur is an inversion ankle sprain, where excessive plantar flexion and supination cause the anterior talofibular ligament to be affected.  A study showed that for a population of Scandinavians, inversion ankle sprains accounted for 85% of all ankle sprains.[26] Most ankle sprains occur in more active people, such as athletes and regular exercisers.
 When an ankle sprain occurs, subsequent ankle sprains are much more likely to follow.[29] The rate of recurrence is particularly high for athletes in high-risk sports.[30] The most widely recommended preventative measures for recurring sprains are wearing ankle-protective gear[31] (tape, or ankle brace) and implementing exercises designed to strengthen the ankle and improve one's balance (e.g., balance ball exercises). In a review article of ankle sprain prevention research, the authors reference a season-long study on a group of soccer players. 60 players wore ankle-protective (tape or ankle-braces) throughout the soccer season, and another 171 players were enrolled in the control group, as they wore no ankle protective gear. At the end of the season, 17% of the players who did not wear ankle braces/tape sprained their ankles, while only 3% of the players who wore protection incurred the same injury. Amongst the players who sprained their ankles and did not wear ankle-protective gear, 25% had a history of previous ankle sprains.[32] Another peer-reviewed article references a study which concluded that ankle exercising could decrease the risk of recurring sprains by 11%.[33]
 In a study comparing the prevalence of ankle sprains between age, race, and sex, individuals who were aged 10–19 years old had highest instances of ankle sprains.[34] It can be suggested that adolescents are more physically active, which leads to higher chances of ankle sprains.  Since sports deal with high utilization of the ankle, over 50% of ankle sprains are due to sport-related injuries.[35]
 Moreover, average ankle sprains for the general U.S. population are estimated at 5–7 ankle sprains for every 1000 person-years; however, a study showed that for military cadets, instances for ankle sprains were about 10 times those of the general population [36]
 Another study comparing gender influences on ankle sprains found that male and female counterparts had similar incidence rates of ankle sprains.  However, at a specific age range of 19–25 years old, males were found to have a substantially greater rate of ankle sprains than females.  Furthermore, at ages 30 and over, females showed a higher incidence of ankle sprains than males.[28]  From this, it can be said that age and activity levels are better indicators of ankle sprain risks than sex.

Strain (injury),https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Strain_(injury),DSS," A strain is an acute or chronic soft tissue injury that occurs to a muscle, tendon, or both (contractile components).[1][2] The equivalent injury to a ligament is a sprain.[3]
 Typical signs and symptoms of a strain include pain, functional loss of the involved structure, muscle weakness, contusion, and localized inflammation.[4] A strain can range from mild annoyance to very painful, depending on the extent of injury.
 A strain can occur as a result of improper body mechanics with any activity (e.g., contact sports, lifting heavy objects, overstretching) that can induce mechanical trauma or injury.[2] Generally, the muscle or tendon overstretches and is placed under more physical stress than it can exert.[2] Strains commonly result in a partial or complete tear of a tendon or muscle, or they can be severe in the form of a complete tendon rupture.[5]  The most common body location for strains to occur is in the foot, leg, or back.[5]
 Degrees of Injury (as classified by the American College of Sports Medicine):[6]
 To establish a uniform definition amongst healthcare providers, in 2012 a Consensus Statement on suggested new terminology and classification of muscle injuries was published.[7]
 The classification suggestion were:
 Indirect Muscle Injury
FUNCTIONAL (Negative MSK US & MRI)[8]
 • Type 2: Neuromuscular muscle disorder
 STRUCTURAL MUSCLE INJURY (Positive MSK US & MRI)[9]
• Type 3: Partial Muscle Tear
• Type 4: (Sub) total tear
 DIRECT MUSCLE INJURY
•  Bump or Cut: Contact-related
 Although strains are not restricted to athletes and can happen while doing everyday tasks, people who play sports are more at risk for developing a strain.[5]  It is common for an injury to develop when there is a sudden increase in duration, intensity, or frequency of an activity.[5]
 The first-line treatment for a muscular strain in the acute phase include five steps commonly known as P.R.I.C.E.[10][11]
 Immediate treatment is usually an adjunctive therapy of NSAIDs and Cold compression therapy.  Controlling the inflammation is critical to the healing process.[citation needed] Cold compression therapy acts to reduce swelling and pain by reducing leukocyte extravasation into the injured area.[12][13]  NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen/paracetamol work to reduce the immediate inflammation by inhibiting Cox-1 & Cox-2 enzymes, which are the enzymes responsible for converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin.[14][15]  However, NSAIDs, including aspirin and ibuprofen, affect platelet function (this is why they are known as ""blood thinners"") and should not be taken during the period when tissue is bleeding because they will tend to increase blood flow, inhibit clotting, and thereby increase bleeding and swelling.[citation needed]  After the bleeding has stopped, NSAIDs can be used with some effectiveness to reduce inflammation and pain.[citation needed]
 A new treatment for acute strains is the use of platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections which have been shown to accelerate recovery from non surgical muscular injuries.[16]
 It is recommended[17] that the person injured should consult a medical provider if the injury is accompanied by severe pain, if the limb cannot be used, or if there is noticeable tenderness over an isolated spot. These can be signs of a broken or fractured bone, a sprain, or a complete muscle tear.

Subluxation,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Subluxation,DSS," In medicine, a subluxation is an incomplete or partial dislocation of a joint or organ.[1]
 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a subluxations is a ""significant structural displacement"" and is therefore always visible on static imaging studies, such as X-rays.[2] This is in direct contrast to the belief of ""vertebral subluxation"" as established in chiropractic, a pseudoscientific field of alternative treatment outside scientific mainstream medicine, whose practitioners (chiropractors) are not medical doctors.
 The exact definition of  subluxation in the medical field depends on the anatomical part being involved.
 A subluxation of a joint is where a connecting bone is partially out of the joint.[3] In contrast to a luxation, which is a complete separation of the joints, a subluxation often returns to its normal position without additional help from a health professional.[4] An example of a joint subluxation is a nursemaid's elbow, which is the subluxation of the head of the radius from the annular ligament. Other joints that are prone to subluxations are the shoulders, fingers, kneecaps, ribs, wrists, ankles, and hips affected by hip dysplasia. A spinal subluxation is visible on X-rays and can sometimes impinge on spinal nerve roots, causing symptoms in the areas served by those roots. In the spine, such a displacement may be caused by a fracture, spondylolisthesis, rheumatoid arthritis,[5] severe osteoarthritis, falls, accidents and other traumas. This is common in Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome.
 A subluxation of the lens within the eye is called ectopia lentis, wherein it is displaced or malpositioned.[6] Subluxated lenses are frequently found in those who have had ocular trauma and those with certain systemic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome and homocystinuria. Some subluxated lenses may require removal, as in the case of those that float freely or those that have opacified to form cataracts.
 A subluxation of a tooth is a dental traumatic injury in which the tooth has increased mobility but has not been displaced from the mandible or maxilla. This is a common condition and one of the most common dental traumatic disorders.[7] Dental subluxation is a non-dental-urgency condition, i.e., unlikely to result in significant morbidity if not seen within 24 hours by a dentist,[8] and usually treated conservatively: good oral hygiene with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of smoking for several days.[8] In painful situations, a temporary splinting of the injured teeth may relieve the pain.[9]
 Subluxation may also occur in the mandible from the articular groove of the temporal bone.[10] The mandible can dislocate in the anterior, posterior, lateral, or superior position. Description of the dislocation is based on the location of the condyle in comparison to the temporal articular groove.[11]

Tear of meniscus,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Tear_of_meniscus,DSS," A tear of a meniscus is a rupturing of one or more of the fibrocartilage strips in the knee called menisci. When doctors and patients refer to ""torn cartilage"" in the knee, they actually may be referring to an injury to a meniscus at the top of one of the tibiae. Menisci can be torn during innocuous activities such as walking or squatting. They can also be torn by traumatic force encountered in sports or other forms of physical exertion. The traumatic action is most often a twisting movement at the knee while the leg is bent. In older adults, the meniscus can be damaged following prolonged 'wear and tear' called a ballsack swelling of the knee joint. Especially acute injuries (typically in younger, more active patients) can lead to displaced tears which can cause mechanical symptoms such as clicking, catching, or locking during motion of the knee joint.[1] The joint will be in pain when in use, but when there is no load, the pain goes away.
 A tear of the medial meniscus[2] can occur as part of the unhappy triad, together with a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament.
 The common signs and symptoms of a torn meniscus are knee pain, particularly along the joint line, and swelling. These are worse when the knee bears more weight (for example, when running). Another typical complaint is joint locking, when the affected person is unable to straighten the leg fully. This can be accompanied by a clicking feeling. Sometimes, a meniscal tear also causes a sensation that the knee gives way.
 A person with a torn meniscus can sometimes remember a specific activity during which the injury was sustained. A tear of the meniscus commonly follows a trauma which involves rotation of the knee while it was slightly bent. These maneuvers also exacerbate the pain after the injury; for example, getting out of a car is often reported as painful.
 There are two menisci in the knee. They sit between the thigh bone and the shin bone. While the ends of the thigh bone and the shin bone have a thin covering of soft hyaline cartilage, the menisci are made of tough fibrocartilage and conform to the surfaces of the bones they rest on. One meniscus rests on the medial tibial plateau; this is the medial meniscus. The other meniscus rests on the lateral tibial plateau; this is the lateral meniscus.[citation needed]
 These menisci act to distribute body weight across the knee joint. Without the menisci, the weight of the body would be unevenly applied to the bones in the legs (the femur and tibia). This uneven weight distribution would cause the development of abnormal excessive forces leading to early damage of the knee joint. The menisci also contribute to the stability of the joint.[citation needed]
 The menisci are nourished by small blood vessels but have a large area in the center with no direct blood supply (avascular). This presents a problem when there is an injury to the meniscus, as the avascular areas tend not to heal. Without the essential nutrients supplied by blood vessels, healing cannot take place.[citation needed]
 The two most common causes of a meniscal tear are traumatic injury (often seen in athletes) and degenerative processes, which are the most common tear seen in all ages of patients. Meniscal tears can occur in all age groups. Traumatic tears are most common in active people aged 10–45. Traumatic tears are usually radial or vertical in the meniscus and more likely to produce a moveable fragment that can catch in the knee and therefore require surgical treatment.[citation needed]
 A meniscus can tear due to an internally or externally rotated knee in a flexed position, with the foot in a flexed position.[3] It is not uncommon for a meniscal tear to occur along with injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament ACL and the medial collateral ligament MCL — these three problems occurring together are known as the ""unhappy triad,"" which is seen in sports such as football when the player is hit on the outside of the knee. Individuals who experience a meniscal tear usually experience pain and swelling as their primary symptoms. Another common complaint is joint locking, or the inability to completely straighten the joint. This is due to a piece of the torn cartilage preventing the normal functioning of the knee joint.[citation needed]
 Degenerative tears are most common in people from age 40 upward but can be found at any age, especially with obesity. Degenerative meniscal tears are thought to occur as part of the aging process when the collagen fibers within the meniscus start to break down and lend less support to the structure of the meniscus. Degenerative tears are usually horizontal, producing both an upper and a lower segment of the meniscus. These segments do not usually move out of place and are therefore less likely to produce mechanical symptoms of catching or locking.[citation needed]
 The meniscus is made of cartilage, a viscoelastic material, which makes it more susceptible to rate of loading injuries. Repetitive loading can also lead to injury. Recent studies have shown people who experience rapid rate of loading and/or repetitive loading to be the most susceptible to meniscus tears. People over the age of 60 who have working conditions in which squatting and kneeling are common are more susceptible to degenerative meniscal tears.[4] Athletes who constantly experience a high rate of loading (i.e. soccer, rugby) are also susceptible to meniscus tears.[4] Studies have also shown with increasing time between ACL injury and ACL reconstruction, there is an increasing chance of meniscus tears. This study showed meniscus tears occurring at a rate of 50–70% depending on how long after the ACL injury the surgery occurred.[5]
 The force distribution is across the knee joint, increasing force concentration on the cartilage and other joint structures.[citation needed]
 Damage to the meniscus due to rotational forces directed to a flexed knee (as may occur with twisting sports) is the usual underlying mechanism of injury. A valgus force applied to a flexed knee with the foot planted and the femur rotated externally can result in a lateral meniscus tear. A varus force applied to the flexed knee when the foot is planted and the femur rotated internally result in a tear of the medial meniscus.[citation needed]
 Tears produce rough surfaces inside the knee, which cause catching, locking, buckling, pain, or a combination of these symptoms. Abnormal loading patterns and rough surfaces inside the knee, especially when coupled with return to sports, significantly increase the risk of developing arthritis if not already present.[citation needed]
 The menisci are C-shaped wedges of fibrocartilage located between the tibial plateau and femoral condyles. The menisci contain 70% type I collagen.[6] The larger semilunar medial meniscus is attached more firmly than the loosely fixed, more circular lateral meniscus. The anterior and posterior horns of both menisci are secured to the tibial plateaus. Anteriorly, the transverse ligament connects the 2 menisci; posteriorly, the meniscofemoral ligament helps stabilize the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the femoral condyle. The coronary ligaments connect the peripheral meniscal rim loosely to the tibia. Although the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) passes in close proximity, the lateral meniscus has no attachment to this structure.[6]
 The joint capsule attaches to the entire periphery of each meniscus but adheres more firmly to the medial meniscus. An interruption in the attachment of the joint capsule to the lateral meniscus, forming the popliteal hiatus, allows the popliteus tendon to pass through to its femoral attachment site. Contraction by the popliteus during knee flexion pulls the lateral meniscus posteriorly, avoiding entrapment within the joint space. The medial meniscus does not have a direct muscular connection. The medial meniscus may shift a few millimeters, while the less stable lateral meniscus may move at least 1 cm.[citation needed]
 In 1978, Shrive et al. reported that the collagen fibers of the menisci are oriented in a circumferential pattern.[6] When a compressive force is applied in the knee joint, a tensile force is transmitted to the menisci. The femur attempts to spread the menisci anteroposteriorly in extension and mediolaterally in flexion. Shrive et al. further studied the effects of a radial cut in the peripheral rim of the menisci during loading. In joints with intact menisci, the force was applied through the menisci and articular cartilage; however, a lesion in the peripheral rim disrupted the normal mechanics of the menisci and allowed it to spread when a load was applied. The load now was distributed directly to the articular cartilage. In light of these findings, it is essential to preserve the peripheral rim during partial meniscectomy to avoid irreversible disruption of the structure's hoop tension capability.[6]
 After noting symptoms, a physician can perform clinical tests to determine if the pain is caused by compression and impingement of a torn meniscus. The knee is examined for swelling. In meniscal tears, pressing on the joint line on the affected side typically Produces tenderness. The McMurray test involves pressing on the joint line while stressing the meniscus (using flexion–extension movements and varus or valgus stress). Similar tests are the Steinmann test (with the patient sitting) and the Apley grind test (a grinding maneuver while the person lies prone and the knee is bent 90°) and the Thessaly test (flexing the affected knee to 20 degrees, pivoting on the knee to see if the pain is reproduced). Bending the knee (into hyperflexion if tolerable), and especially squatting, is typically a painful maneuver if the meniscus is torn. The range of motion of the joint is often restricted.
 Cooper's sign is present in over 92% of tears. It is a subjective symptom of pain in the affected knee when turning over in bed at night. Osteoarthritic pain is present with weightbearing, but the meniscal tear causes pain with a twisting motion of the knee as the meniscal fragment gets pinched, and the capsular attachment gets stretched causing the complaint of pain.
 X-ray images (normally during weightbearing) can be obtained to rule out other conditions or to see if the patient also has osteoarthritis. The menisci themselves cannot be visualised with plain radiographs. If the diagnosis is not clear from the history and examination, the menisci can be imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (an MRI scan). This technique has replaced previous arthrography, which involved injecting contrast medium into the joint space. In straightforward cases, knee arthroscopy allows quick diagnosis and simultaneous treatment. Recent clinical data shows that MRI and clinical testing are comparable in sensitivity and specificity when looking for a meniscal tear.[citation needed]
 A meniscal tear can be classified in various ways, such as by anatomic location or by proximity to blood supply. Various tear patterns and configurations have been described.[7] These include:
 These tears can then be further classified by their proximity to the meniscus blood supply, namely whether they are located in the “red-red,” “red-white,” or “white-white” zones.
 The functional importance of these classifications, however, is to ultimately determine whether a meniscus is repairable. The repairability of a meniscus depends on a number of factors. These include:
 Tear of a meniscus is a common injury in many sports. The menisci hold 30–50% of the body load in standing position.[8] Some sports where a meniscus tear is common are American football, association football, ice hockey and tennis.  Regardless of what the activity is, it is important to take the correct precautions to prevent a meniscus tear from happening.
 There are three major ways of preventing a meniscus tear. The first of these is wearing the correct footwear for the sport and surface that the activity is taking place on. This means that if the sport being played is association football, cleats are an important item in reducing the risk of a meniscus tear.[9] The proper footwear is imperative when engaging in physical activity because one off-balanced step could mean a meniscus tear.[10] 
It is highly advised that cleats contain a sole that molds around the foot, no fewer than fourteen cleats per shoe, no lower than a half inch diameter of the cleat tip, and at most, a three-eighths inch of cleat length.[11]
 The second way to prevent a meniscus tear is to strengthen and stretch the major leg muscles.[12]  Those muscles include the hamstrings, quadriceps, and calf muscles. One popular exercise used to strengthen the hamstrings is the leg curl.  It is also important to properly stretch the hamstrings; doing standing toe touches can do this.  Seated leg extensions strengthen the quadriceps and doing the quadriceps stretch will help loosen the muscles. Toe raises are used to strengthen and stretch the calves.[12]
Adequate muscle mass and strength may also aid in maintaining healthy knees.  The use of the parallel squat increases much needed stability in the knee if executed properly.  Execution of the parallel squat will develop the lower body muscles that will strengthen the hips, knees, and ankles.[13]
 The last major way to prevent a tear in the meniscus is learning proper technique for the movement that is taking place.[14] For the sports involving quick powerful movements it is important to learn how to cut, turn, land from a jump, and stop correctly. It is important to take the time out to perfect these techniques when used. These three major techniques will significantly prevent and reduce the risk of a meniscus tear.
 Presently, treatments make it possible for quicker recovery. If the tear is not serious, physical therapy, compression, elevation and icing the knee can heal the meniscus.[15] More serious tears may require surgical procedures. Surgery, however, does not appear to be better than non-surgical care.[16]
 Initial treatment may include physical therapy, bracing, anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroid injections to increase flexibility, endurance, and strength.[17]
 Exercises can strengthen the muscles around the knee, especially the quadriceps. Stronger and bigger muscles will protect the meniscus cartilage by absorbing a part of the weight. The patient may be given paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medications.
 For patients with non-surgical treatment, physical therapy program is designed to reduce symptoms of pain and swelling at the affected joint. This type of rehabilitation focuses on maintenance of full range of motion and functional progression without aggravating the symptoms.[18] Physical therapists can use modalities such as electric stimulation, cold therapy, and ultrasonography.
 Recently, accelerated rehabilitation programs have been used and shown to be as successful as the conservative program.[19] The program reduces the time the patient spends using crutches and allows weight bearing activities. The less conservative approach allows the patient to apply a small amount of stress and prevent range of motion losses.[19] It is likely that a patient with a peripheral tear may pursue the accelerated program and a patient with a larger tear will use the conservative program.
 Arthroscopy is a surgical technique in which a joint is operated on using an endoscopic camera as opposed to open surgery on the joint. The meniscus can either be repaired or completely removed; this is described in further detail below.[15] It should not be recommended for a degenerative meniscus tear, unless there is locking or catching of the knee, recurrent effusion or persistent pain.[17] Evidence suggests that it is no better than conservative management in those with and without osteoarthritis.[20][21] There does not appear to be any benefit in adults with a tear of the meniscus who have mild arthritis.[21]
 An independent international guideline panel that did not have any conflicts of interest makes a strong recommendation against arthroscopy for degenerative meniscus tears; this conclusion was reached on the basis that there is high-quality evidence that there is no lasting benefit and less than 15% of people even have a small short-term benefit.[20] The disadvantages of arthroscopy for meniscal tear repair include a two to six week recovery time and rare but serious adverse effects that can occur, including blood clots in the legs, surgical site infections, and nerve damage.[22][23][24] The BMJ Rapid Recommendation includes infographics and shared decision-making tools to facilitate a conversation between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of arthroscopic surgery.[20]
 If the injury to the meniscus is isolated, then the knee would be relatively stable. However, if another injury such as an anterior cruciate ligament injury (torn ACL) was coupled with a torn meniscus, then an arthroscopy would be performed.
A meniscal repair has a higher success rate if there is an adequate blood supply to the peripheral rim.[25] The interior of the meniscus is avascular, but the blood supply can penetrate up to about 6 millimeters or a quarter inch. Therefore, meniscus tears that occur near the peripheral rim are able to heal after a meniscal repair. 
A study conducted by Heckman, Barber-Westin & Noyes found that it is better to repair the meniscus than rather remove it (meniscectomy). The amount of rehabilitation time required for a repair is longer than a meniscectomy, but removing the meniscus can cause osteoarthritis problems. If the meniscus is removed, the patient will be in rehab for about four to six weeks. If a repair is conducted, then the patient will need four to six months.
If physical therapy does not resolve the symptoms, or in cases of a locked knee, then surgical intervention may be required. Depending on the location of the tear, a repair may be possible. In the outer third of the meniscus, an adequate blood supply exists and a repair will likely heal.[1] Usually younger patients are more resilient and respond well to this treatment, while older, more sedentary patients do not have a favorable outcome after a repair.[26]
 Meniscus transplants are accomplished successfully regularly, although it is still somewhat of a rare procedure and many questions surrounding its use remain.[26][27]
Side effects of meniscectomy include:
 Another treatment approach in development is a meniscus implant or ""artificial meniscus."" While many artificial joints and bionic body parts are available to patients, including arms, legs, joints and other body parts, a prosthetic replacement for the meniscus has eluded modern medicine.[28] Several initiatives are underway.
 The first to be implanted in humans is called the NUsurface Meniscus Implant. The surgery took place in January 2015 at The Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.[29][30] The NUsurface Implant is made from medical grade plastic and is designed not to require fixation to bone or soft tissue.[31] The implant is currently being tested in two FDA-approved clinical trials, which completed enrollment in June 2018.[32] The manufacturer is expecting to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. in the next two years.[33] If approved by the FDA, the implant could be a good option for younger, active patients who are considered too young for knee replacement because that surgery only lasts about 10 years.[34]
 Other early stage meniscus implants include TRAMMPOLIN and Orthonika.[35][36][37]
 Scientists are also working to grow an artificial meniscus in the lab. Scientists from Cornell and Columbia universities grew a new meniscus inside the knee joint of a sheep using a 3-D printer and the body's own stem cells.[28][38] Similarly, researchers at Scripps Clinic’s Shiley Center for Orthopaedic Research and Education have also reported growing a whole meniscus. Animal testing will be needed before the replacement meniscus can be used in people, and then clinical trials would follow to determine its effectiveness. Currently, there's no timeline for the clinical trials, but it is estimated it will take years to determine if the lab-grown meniscus is safe and effective.[39]
 After a successful surgery for treating the destroyed part of the meniscus, patients must follow a rehabilitation program to have the best result. The rehabilitation following a meniscus surgery depends on whether the entire meniscus was removed or repaired.
 If the destroyed part of the meniscus was removed, patients can usually start walking using a crutch a day or two after surgery. Although each case is different, patients return to their normal activities on average after a few weeks (2 or 3). Still, a completely normal walk will resume gradually, and it's not unusual to take 2–3 months for the recovery to reach a level where a patient will walk totally smoothly. Many meniscectomy patients don't ever feel a 100% functional recovery, but even years after the procedure they sometimes feel tugging or tension in a part of their knee.[citation needed] There is little medical follow-up after meniscectomy and official medical documentation tends to ignore the imperfections and side-effects of this procedure.
 If the meniscus was repaired, the rehabilitation program that follows is a lot more intensive. After the surgery a hinged knee brace is sometimes placed on the patient. This brace allows controlled movement of the knee. The patient is encouraged to walk using crutches from the first day, and most of the times can put partial weight on the knee.
 Improving symptoms, restoring function, and preventing further injuries are the main goals when rehabilitating.[40]  By the end of rehabilitation, normal range of motion, function of muscles and coordination of the body are restored.[40] Personalized rehabilitation programs are designed considering the patient’s surgery type, location repaired (medial or lateral), simultaneous knee injuries, type of meniscal tear, age of patient, condition of the knee, loss of strength and ROM, and the expectations and motivations of the patient.[41]
 There are three phases that follow meniscal surgery. Each phase consists of rehabilitation goals, exercises, and criteria to move on to the next phase. Phase I starts immediately following surgery to 4–6 weeks or until the patient is able meet progression criteria. The goals are to restore normal knee extension, reduce and eliminate swelling, regain leg control, and protect the knee (Fowler, PJ and D. Pompan, 1993). During the first 5 days following the surgery, a passive continuous motion machine is used to prevent a prolonged period of immobilization which leads to muscular atrophy and delays functional recovery.[42] During the 4–6 weeks post-surgical, active and passive non-weight bearing motions which flex the knee up to 90ᵒ are recommended. For patients with meniscal transplantation, further knee flexion can damage the allograft because of the increased shear forces and stresses.If any weight-bearing exercises are applied, a controlled brace should be worn on the knee to keep the knee at near (<10ᵒ) or full extension.[43]  
The suggested exercises target increasing the patient’s ROM, muscular and neuromuscular strength, and cardiovascular endurance. Aquatic therapy, or swimming, can be used to rehab patients because it encompasses ROM, strength, and cardiovascular exercises while relieving stress on the body. It has also been shown to significantly improve dependent edema and pain symptoms.[44]  No pain gait without crutches, swelling and 4–6 weeks after surgery are the criteria to begin the next phase (Ulrich G.S., and S Aroncyzk, 1993).
 
This phase of the rehabilitation program is 6 to 14 weeks after the surgery. The goals for Phase II include being able to restore full ROM, normalized gait, and performing functional movements with control and no pain (Fowler, PJ and D. Pompan, 1993). Also, muscular strengthening and neuromuscular training are emphasized using progressive weight bearing and balance exercises. Exercises in this phase can increase knee flexion for more than 90ᵒ.[45]  Advised exercises include stationary bicycle, standing on foam surface with two and one leg, abdominal and back strengthening, and quadriceps strengthening. The proposed criteria include normal gait on all surfaces and single leg balance longer than 15 seconds (Ulrich G.S., and S Aroncyzk, 1993).  Patients begin exercises in phase III 14 to 22 weeks after surgery. Phase III’s goal and final criteria is to perform sport/work specific movements with no pain or swelling (Fowler, PJ and D. Pompan, 1993).  Drills for maximal muscle control, strength, flexibility,[45] movements specific to patient’s work/sport, low to high rate exercises, and abdominal and back strengthening exercises are all recommended exercises (Ulrich G.S., and S Aroncyzk, 1993). Exercises to increase cardiovascular fitness are also applied to fully prepare the patients to return to their desired activities.
 If the progression criteria are met, the patient can gradually return to ""high-impact"" activities (like running). However, ""heavier activities"", like running, skiing, basketball etc., generally any activities where knees bear sudden changes of the direction of movement can lead to repeated injuries. When planning sport activities it makes sense to consult a physical therapist and check how much impact the sport will have on the knee.
 The meniscal tear is the most common knee injury. It tends to be more frequent in sports that have rough contact or pivoting sports such as soccer. It is more common in males than females, with a ratio of about two and a half males to one female. Males between the ages of 31 and 40 tend to tear their meniscus more frequently than younger men. Females seem to be more likely to tear their meniscus between the ages of 11 and 20.[citation needed]
 People who work in straining jobs such as construction or professional sports are also more likely to have a meniscal tear because of the different tensions to which their knees are subjected.
 According to the United States National Library of Medicine, the isolated medial meniscal tear occurs more frequently than any other tear associated with the meniscus. The prevalence of meniscus tears is the same for both knees.  In a few different studies the BMI of a person is shown to have a greater effect on the frequency of a meniscus tear; having a higher BMI will result in more weight on the joints, which can cause the knee to be non-aligned, which causes more weight on the muscles, resulting in an easier tear.
 In 2008 the U.S Department of Health and Human Services reported a combined total of 2,295 discharges for the principal diagnosis of tear of lateral cartilage/meniscus (836.0), tear of medial cartilage/meniscus (836.1), and tear of cartilage/meniscus (836.2).  Females had a total of 53.49% discharges, while males had 45.72%. Individuals between the ages of 45 and 68 had an average of 31.73% discharges followed by age group 65–84, with 28.82%. The average length of stay for a patient diagnosed with torn menisci was 2.7 days for males and 3.7 days for females. There was a report of 6,941 hospital discharges for knee repair. Individuals between age 18 and 44 were among the highest with 37.37% total of discharges, followed by the age group 45–64, with a percentage of 36.34%. Males had a slightly higher number of discharges (50.78%) than females (48.66%). The average length of stay for both male and female patients in a hospital setting was 3.1.[46]

Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the thumb,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_injury_of_the_thumb,DSS," Gamekeeper's thumb (also known as skier's thumb or UCL tear) is a type of injury to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb. The UCL may be torn, damaged or in some cases avulsed from its insertion site into the proximal phalanx of the thumb in the vast majority (approximately 90%) of cases.[1] This condition is commonly observed among gamekeepers and Scottish fowl hunters, as well as athletes (such as volleyballers). It also occurs among people who sustain a fall onto an outstretched hand, frequently skiers.
 Symptoms of gamekeeper's thumb are instability of the MCP joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and weakness of the pinch grasp. The severity of the symptoms are related to the extent of the initial tear of the UCL (in the case of Skier's thumb), or how long the injury has been allowed to progress (in the case of gamekeeper's thumb).
 Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and ecchymosis around the thenar eminence, and especially over the MCP joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the MCP joint of the thumb.
 The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the thumb on an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.
 Gamekeeper's thumb and skier's thumb are two similar conditions, both of which involve insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb. The chief difference between these two conditions is that Skier's thumb is generally considered to be an acute condition acquired after a fall or similar abduction injury to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb, whereas gamekeeper's thumb typically refers to a chronic condition which has developed as a result of repeated episodes of lower-grade hyperabduction over a period of time. Gamekeeper's thumb is more difficult to treat because the UCL has lengthened and become thinner as a result of repeated injury. It is moderately painful compared to similar injuries.
 In addition to skiing, this injury (resulting from forced abduction or hyperextension of the proximal phalanx of the thumb) is seen in a wide variety of other athletic endeavors. The most common mechanism of injury appears to be when a person extends the arm in an attempt to block a fall.  The stress resulting from falling onto an abducted thumb produces a valgus force on the MCP joint of the thumb, resulting in a sprain or tear of the UCL.[2]
 In a recent study, 49% of UCL disruptions of the thumb were caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand. Sports injuries accounted for most of the remaining injuries, with only 2.4% acquired as a result of skiing injuries.[3]
 The ulnar collateral ligament is an important stabilizer of the thumb. Thumb instability resulting from disruption of the UCL profoundly impairs the overall function of the involved hand. Because of this, it is critical that these injuries receive appropriate attention and treatment.
 In most cases of a complete tear, the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle may be interposed between the bones of the MCP joint and the torn ligament. When this condition (referred to as a Stener lesion) occurs, the adequate healing of the tear is prevented altogether. For a Stener lesion to occur, a complete tear of the ulnar collateral ligament must be present.  However, the Stener lesion can occur even in the absence of a tear of the accessory collateral ligament or volar plate. The Stener lesion is present in more than 80% of complete ruptures of the UCL of the thumb.
 When approaching this type of injury, the physician must first determine whether there is an incomplete rupture (or sprain) of the UCL, or a complete rupture. If the UCL is completely disrupted, the physician must then determine whether there is interposition of the adductor aponeurosis (Stener lesion), or simply a complete rupture of the UCL with anatomic or near-anatomic position.  Radiographs are helpful in determining the possible presence of an avulsion fracture of the proximal phalanx insertion site of the ulnar collateral ligament.   Stress examination, or one done under fluoroscopic guidance, can help determine the integrity of the ligament.
 Most gamekeeper's thumb partial injuries are treated by simply immobilizing the joint in a thumb spica splint or a modified wrist splint and allowing the ligament to heal. However, near total or total tears of the UCL may require surgery to achieve a satisfactory repair, especially if accompanied by a Stener lesion.[4]
 CS Campbell, an orthopedic surgeon, originally coined the term gamekeeper's thumb in 1955, after he observed this condition in a series of 24 Scottish gamekeepers.[5] The injury appeared to occur as a result of the particular manner in which they killed small animals such as rabbits; the animals were placed on the ground, and their necks were broken as the gamekeeper exerted downward pressure with the thumb and index finger. This maneuver would place a valgus force upon the abducted metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Over time, this would lead to insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb.
 Others have noted that Scottish fowl or game hunters would develop this type of injury after carrying their game home in a leather thong, which they would attach to their thumb and drape over their shoulder.
 The term skier's thumb is derived from the fact that skiers often acquire this type of injury by falling against a planted ski pole, tearing the UCL by hyperabducting it.[6]

Unhappy triad,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Unhappy_triad,DSS," The unhappy triad, also known as a blown knee among other names, is an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and meniscus. Analysis during the 1990s indicated that this 'classic' O'Donoghue triad is actually an unusual clinical entity among athletes with knee injuries. Some authors mistakenly believe that in this type of injury, ""combined anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament (ACL- MCL) disruptions that were incurred during athletic endeavors"" always present with concomitant medial meniscus injury. However, the 1990 analysis showed that lateral meniscus tears are more common than medial meniscus tears in conjunction with sprains of the ACL.[2]
 The unhappy triad occurs due to a lateral blow to the knee causing a rupture in the anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and meniscus. Injury is most often sustained when a lateral (from the outside) force impacts the knee while the foot is fixed on the ground. The strong valgus or rotary force to the knee tears the ACL, MCL, and medial meniscus all together. This type of injury occurs often in contact sports such as football, rugby, or motocross.  During the injury, the leg is laterally rotated and over-abducted. In about 10% of cases, the force is applied to the opposite side of the knee, and the lateral and posterolateral ligaments are torn.
 Skeletal components involved in the unhappy triad include: patella, femur, tibia.
No muscles are directly involved in this injury, only ligaments; However, strengthening the hip flexor and hip extensor muscles may help alleviate the injury.
 The medial collateral ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, and lateral collateral ligament are the four primary ligaments of the knee. The medial and lateral collateral ligaments primarily provide support to varus and valgus forces whereas the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments prevent anterior and posterior translation of the tibia on the femur.[3]
 The classic O'Donoghue triad is characterized by an injury to three knee structures (in order): 
 The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the four crucial ligaments in the knee. It originates from the lateral condyle of the femur and goes to the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia. Its function is to provide stability in the knee and minimize stress across the knee joint. It also restrains excessive forward movement in the leg and limits rotational movements in the knee.
 Injury
 An anterior cruciate ligament injury results from excess tension on the ligament. This can come from a sudden stop or twisting motion of the knee. A few initial symptoms include swelling, knee instability, and pain. A popping sound or sensation may or may not be heard when the ACL first tears. A following symptom usually includes the feeling of the knee ""giving out"". Tearing of the ACL is the most significant injury because it leaves the knee unstable, which also causes the knee to lose its normal function.
 Epidemiology
 It is estimated that 100,000 new anterior cruciate ligament injuries occur in the U.S. each year.[7] Approximately half of the new ACL injuries involve injuries to the ligament, tendon, and or muscle of that affected knee.[8]  Women are at greater risk for ACL injuries than men due to their greater Q angle. The Q angle is the angle formed by a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to central patella and a second line drawn from central patella to tibial tubercle.
 The medial meniscus is a C-wedge shaped piece of cartilage that acts as a""shock absorber"" between the femur and the tibia.  Each knee has two menisci, one at the outer edge and one at the inner edge of the knee. The menisci are tough and rubber-like to help cushion the joint and help keep it stable.
 The lateral meniscus is also known as the external semilunar fibrocartilage. It is a fibrocartilage band on the lateral side of the knee joint and can easily be injured with torsional stress or direct force.
 Each knee has a medial and lateral meniscus, consisting of connective tissue and collagen fibers. Menisci are needed to distribute the body weight across the knee. Without them, the body weight is distributed unevenly on the femur and tibia, possibly leading to early arthritis in the knee joint. The menisci are nourished by small blood vessels, but each has a large central section which is avascular and does not get a direct blood supply. This poses a problem in a meniscus injury, as blood flow is diminished and the avascular areas tend to not heal.
 Injury
 The tear of meniscus is among the most common knee injuries. It is usually caused by torsional stress; twisting or turning of the knee too quickly with the foot planted on the ground while the knee is flexed. The feeling of a ""pop"" in the knee is usually felt when the meniscus is torn. Athletes, particularly those who participate in contact sports, are at a greater risk for meniscal tears. Sports-related meniscal tears often occur with other knee injuries, such as an anterior cruciate ligament tear.
 A torn meniscus is commonly referred to as torn cartilage in the knee. Menisci tear in different ways and are noted by how they look, as well as where the tear occurs in the meniscus. Two types of tears include minor, which includes stiffness and swelling within two to three days but usually goes away in two to three weeks. Then there is severe, which without treatment, a piece of meniscus may come loose and drift into the joint space. Tears include longitudinal, parrot-beak, flap, bucket handle, and mixed/complex. Image of meniscal tear
 Epidemiology
 Injury to the medial meniscus is about five times greater than injury to the lateral meniscus due to its anatomical attachment to the MCL.[9] Lateral meniscal tears are more common in acute ACL injuries, whereas medial mensical injuries are more common in chronic ACL-deficient knees and more amenable to repair.[10]
 Meta-analysis shows that in acute injuries of the ACL associated with a meniscus tear, 44% were of the medial meniscus, whereas 56% were of the lateral meniscus; in chronic ACL insufficiency, 70% were medial whereas 30% were lateral.[11]
 Injury
 Because the medial collateral ligament resists widening of the inside of the knee joint, the ligament is usually injured when the outside of the knee joint is struck. This force causes the outside of the knee to buckle, and the inside to widen. When the MCL is stretched too far, it is susceptible to tearing and injury. This is the injury seen by the action of ""clipping"" in a football game.
 An injury to the MCL may occur as an isolated injury, or it may be part of a complex injury to the knee. Other ligaments ACL, or meniscus, may be torn along with a MCL injury.
 Symptoms
 The most common symptom following an MCL injury is pain directly over the ligament. Swelling over the torn ligament may appear, and bruising and generalized joint swelling are common 1 to 2 days after the injury. In more severe injuries, patients may complain that the knee feels unstable.
 Treatment
 Treatment of an MCL tear depends on the severity of the injury. Treatment always begins with allowing the pain to subside, beginning work on mobility, followed by strengthening the knee to return to sports and activities. Bracing can often be useful for treatment of MCL injuries. Fortunately, most often surgery is not necessary for the treatment of an MCL tear.
 Treatment of the unhappy triad usually requires surgery. An ACL surgery is common and the meniscus can be treated during the surgery as well. The MCL is rehabilitated through time and immobilization. Physical therapy after the surgery and the use of a knee brace help speed up the healing process. 
A typical surgery for a blown knee includes:
 The goal of reconstruction surgery is to prevent instability and restore the function of the torn ligament, creating a stable knee. There are certain factors that the patient must consider when deciding for or against surgery.
 A study containing 100 consecutive patients with a recent anterior cruciate ligament injury were examined with respect to type of sports activity that caused the injury. Of the 100 consecutive ACL injuries, there were also 53 medial collateral ligament injuries, 12 medial, 35 lateral and 11 bicompartmental meniscal lesions. 59/100 patients were injured during contact sports, 30/100 in downhill skiing and 11/100 in other recreational activities, traffic accidents or at work.[12]
 An associated medial collateral ligament tear was more common in skiing (22/30) than during contact sports (23/59), whereas a bicompartmental meniscal lesion was found more frequently in contact sports (9/59) than in skiing (0/30). Weightbearing was reported by 56/59 of the patients with contact sports injuries whereas 8/30 of those with skiing injuries. Non-weightbearing in the injury situation led to the same rate of MCL tears (18/28) as weightbearing (35/72) but significantly more intact menisci (19/28 vs 23/72). Thus, contact sports injuries were more often sustained during weightbearing, with a resultant joint compression of both femuro-tibial compartments as shown by the higher incidence of bicompartmental meniscal lesions. The classic ""unhappy triad"" was a rare finding (8/100) and Fridén T, Erlandsson T, Zätterström R, Lindstrand A, and Moritz U. suggest that this entity should be replaced by the ""unhappy compression injury"".[12]
 In 1936, Cambell stated that an ""impairment of the anterior crucial and medial ligaments is associated with injuries of the internal cartilage"". In 1950, O'Donoghue described the unhappy triad as: (1) rupture of the medial collateral ligament, (2) damage to the medial meniscus and (3) rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. O'Donoghue estimated the incidence rate in the traumatic sports knee to be 25%.[4]
 In 1991, Shelbourne and Nitz questioned the validity of O'Donoghue's terrible triad study. A review of all arthroscopically confirmed acute injuries of second degree or worse to the ACL and MCL was performed. Of the 52 knees reviewed, 80% of group 1 had lateral meniscus tears and 29% had associated medial meniscus tears. None of the medial meniscus tears were isolated; medial meniscus tears were not present in the absence of a lateral meniscus tear.[4] From this study, it was concluded that the structures more typically involved in a triad were the anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and the lateral (not medial) meniscus.
 The term ""unhappy triad"" was coined by O'Donoghue in 1950.[4][13][14] However, since then, this term and the term ""terrible triad"" have also been used to describe several other combinations of joint injuries, including the terrible triad of the elbow[15] and shoulder.[16]
 The term ""terrible triad"" is also sometimes used in the popular press to describe conditions relating to pain, or even to refer to the MacDonald triad of sociopathic behavior.

Whiplash (medicine),https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Whiplash_(medicine),DSS," Whiplash  is a non-medical term describing a range of injuries to the neck caused by or related to a sudden distortion of the neck[1] associated with extension,[2] although the exact injury mechanisms remain unknown. The term ""whiplash"" is a colloquialism. ""Cervical acceleration–deceleration"" (CAD) describes the mechanism of the injury, while the term ""whiplash associated disorders"" (WAD) describes the injury sequelae and symptoms.
 Whiplash is commonly associated with motor vehicle accidents, usually when the vehicle has been hit in the rear;[3] however, the injury can be sustained in many other ways, including headbanging,[4] bungee jumping and falls.[5] It is one of the most frequently claimed injuries on vehicle insurance policies in certain countries; for example, in the United Kingdom 430,000 people made an insurance claim for whiplash in 2007, accounting for 14% of every driver's premium.[6]
 Before the invention of the car, whiplash injuries were called ""railway spine"" as they were noted mostly in connection with train collisions. The first case of severe neck pain arising from a train collision was documented around 1919.[7] The number of whiplash injuries has since risen sharply due to rear-end motor vehicle collisions. Given the wide variety of symptoms associated with whiplash injuries, the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated Disorders coined the phrase 'Whiplash-Associated Disorders'.[7]
 While there is broad consensus that acute whiplash is not uncommon, the topic of chronic whiplash is controversial, with studies in at least three countries showing zero to low prevalence, and some academics positing a linkage to financial issues.[8]
 Symptoms reported by sufferers include: pain and aching to the neck and back, referred pain to the shoulders, sensory disturbance (such as pins and needles) to the arms and legs, and headaches. Symptoms can appear directly after the injury, but often are not felt until days afterwards.[3]  Whiplash is usually confined to the spine.  The most common areas of the spine affected by whiplash are the neck and middle of the spine. ""Neck"" pain is very common between the shoulder and the neck.  The ""missing link"" of whiplash may be towards or inside the shoulder and this would explain why neck therapy alone frequently does not give lasting relief.[9][10][11][12][13]
 Cognitive symptoms following whiplash trauma, such as being easily distracted or irritated, seems to be common and possibly linked to a poorer prognosis.[14]
 The exact injury mechanism that causes whiplash injuries is forceful sudden hyperextension followed by hyperflexion of the cervical vertebrae, mainly spraining the nuchal ligament and the Anterior Longitudinal Ligament respectively. A whiplash injury may be the result of impulsive retracting of the spine, mainly the ligament: anterior longitudinal ligament which is stretched or tears, as the head snaps forward and then back again causing a whiplash injury.[15]
 A whiplash injury from an automobile accident is called a cervical acceleration–deceleration injury. Cadaver studies have shown that as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a kyphosis while the upper cervical spine maintains its lordosis. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.
 Whiplash may be caused by any motion similar to a rear-end collision in a motor vehicle, such as may take place on a roller coaster[16] or other rides at an amusement park, sports injuries such as skiing accidents, other modes of transportation such as airplane travel, or from being hit, kicked or shaken.[17][citation needed].
 Whiplash associated disorders sometimes include injury to the cerebrum. In a severe cervical acceleration–deceleration syndrome, a brain injury known as a coup-contra-coup injury occurs. A coup-contra-coup injury occurs as the brain is accelerated into the cranium as the head and neck hyperextend, and is then accelerated into the other side as the head and neck rebound to hyper-flexion or neutral position.
 ""Volunteer studies of experimental, low-velocity rear-end collisions have shown a percentage of subjects to report short-lived symptoms"",[18]
 From this type of research it has been inferred that whiplash symptoms might not always have any pathological (injury) explanation.
 However, over the last decade, academic surgeons in the UK and US have sought to unravel the whiplash enigma.  A 1000-case, four-year observational study published in 2012 said that the ""missing link"" in whiplash injuries is the trapezius muscle which may be damaged through eccentric muscle contraction during the whiplash mechanism described above and below.[9]  Another study[19] suggested that ""shneck pain"" was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic[20] and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident.  Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement during the day and night time.[21][how?]  All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck.  Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.
 Whiplash can be described as a sudden strain to the muscles, bones and nerves in the neck. The neck is made up of seven vertebrae, referred to as the cervical vertebrae. The first two cervical vertebrae, the axis and atlas, are shaped differently from the remaining five. The atlas and axis are responsible for movement of the skull from side to side (cervical rotation to the right and left); also moving forward and backward (cervical flexion and extension). Excessive extension and flexion can disrupt the vertebrae.
 There are four phases that occur during ""whiplash"": Initial position (before the collision), retraction, extension and rebound.  In the initial position there is no force on the neck it is stable due to inertia.[22] Anterior longitudinal ligament injuries in whiplash may lead to cervical instability.[23] They explain that during the retraction phase that is when the actual ""whiplash"" occurs, since there is an unusual loading of soft tissues. The next phase is the extension, the whole neck and head switches to extension, and it is stopped or limited by the head restraint.  The rebound phase transpires as result of the phases that are mentioned.
 During the retraction phase the spine forms an S-Shaped curve, and this caused by the flexion in the upper planes and hyperextension at the lower planes and this exceed their physiological limits this phase the injuries occur to the lower cervical vertebrae. At the extension phase all cervical vertebrae and the head are fully extended, but do not surpass their physiological limits. Most of the injuries happen in C-5 and C-6.[24]
 While the time associated with a specific collision will vary, the following provides an example of the occupant and seat interaction sequence for a collision lasting approximately 300 milliseconds.[citation needed]
 Diagnosis occurs through a patient history, head and neck examination, X-rays to rule out bone fractures and may involve the use of medical imaging to determine if there are other injuries.[25]
 The Québec Task Force (QTF) has divided whiplash-associated disorders into five grades.[26]
 The focus of preventive measures to date has been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness  of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.[3]
 For the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of head restraints to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of head restraints have been developed by various manufactures to protect their occupants from whiplash.[27] 
Below are definitions of different types of head restraints.[28]
 Head restraint — refers to a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant's head in relation to the torso in order to reduce the risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most effective head restraint must allow a backset motion of less than 60 mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact.[29]
 Integrated head restraint or fixed head restraint — refers to a head restraint formed by the upper part of the seat back, or a head restraint that is not height adjustable and cannot be detached from the seat or the vehicle structure except by the use of tools or following the partial or total removal of the seat furnishing"". 
 Adjustable head restraint — refers to a head restraint that is capable of being positioned to fit the morphology of the seated occupant. The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment. 
 Active head restraint — refers to a device designed to automatically improve head restraint position and/or geometry during an impact"". 
 Automatically adjusting head restraint — refers to a head restraint that automatically adjusts the position of the head restraint when the seat position is adjusted. 
 A major issue in whiplash prevention is the lack of proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement of the head and neck during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant's head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.[30][31]
 In contrast to a properly adjusted head restraint, research suggests that there may be an increased risk of neck injuries if the head restraint is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and seat-back systems. 
 In most passenger vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, the height of the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.
In a sitting position, the minimum height of the restraint should correspond to the top of the driver's ear or even higher. In addition, there should be minimal distance between the back of head and the point where it first meets the restraint. 
 Due to low public awareness of the consequence of incorrect positioning of head restraints, some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants.
 Some current systems are:
 The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and other testing centers around the world have been involved in testing the effectiveness of head restraint and seat systems in laboratory conditions to assess their ability to prevent or mitigate whiplash injuries. They have found that over 60% of new motor vehicles on the market have ""good"" rated head restraints. Various organisations exist which list such vehicles
 Symptoms remaining more than six months after trauma is labelled Whiplash syndrome. The main purpose with early rehabilitation is to reduce the risk for development of Whiplash syndrome. Early rehabilitation for whiplash depends on the grade category. It can be categorized as grade 0 being no pain to grade 4 with a cervical bone fracture or dislocation.  Grade 4 obviously needs admission to hospital while grade 0-3 can be managed as outpatients. The symptoms from the potential injury to the cervical spine may be debilitating, and pain was reported to be one of the biggest stressor events experienced in daily living, so it is important to begin rehabilitation immediately to prevent future pain.[35]
 Current research supports that active mobilization rather than a soft collar results in a more prompt recovery both in the short[36] and long term[37] perspective. Furthermore, Schnabel and colleagues stated that the soft collar is not a suitable medium for rehabilitation, and the best way of recovery is to include an active rehabilitation program that includes physical therapy exercises and postural modifications.[36] Another study found patients who participated in active therapy shortly after injury increased mobilization of the neck with significantly less pain within four weeks when compared to patients using a cervical collar.[38]
 Active treatments are light repetitive exercises that work the area to maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the patient that exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck. These exercises are done at home or under the care of a health professional.[39] When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it's important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until pain threshold three to five times per day, flexion and extension of the shoulder joint by moving the arms up and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling.[35] Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate.[35] Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery.[40] Rosenfeld found that doing active exercises as often as once every waken hour during one month after trauma decreases the need for sick leave three years after trauma from 25% to 5.7%.[37]
 Passive treatments such as acupuncture, massage therapy, and stimulation may sometimes be used as a complement to active exercises.[41] Return to normal activities of daily living should be encouraged as soon as possible to maximize and expedite full recovery.[42][citation needed]
 For chronic whiplash patients, rehabilitation is recommended.  Patients who entered a rehabilitation program said they were able to control their pain, they continued to use strategies that were taught to them, and were able to go back to their daily activities.[43]
 According to the recommendations made by the Quebec Task Force, treatment for individuals with whiplash associated disorders grade 1–3 may include non-narcotic analgesics. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be prescribed in the case of WAD 2 and WAD 3, but their use should be limited to a maximum of three weeks. Botulinum toxin A is used to treat involuntary muscle contraction and spasms.  Botulinum toxin type-A is only temporary and repeated injections need to take place in order to feel the effects.[44]
 According to a year long follow-up study in 2008 on 186 patients, the WAD-classification and Quebec Task Force regimen were not linked to better clinical outcomes.[45]
 The consequences of whiplash range from mild pain for a few days (which is the case for most people),[46] to severe disability. It seems that around 50% will have some remaining symptoms.[37][47]
 Alterations in resting state cerebral blood flow have been demonstrated in patients with chronic pain after whiplash injury.[48] There is evidence for persistent inflammation in the neck in patients with chronic pain after whiplash injury.[49]
 There has long been a proposed link between whiplash injuries and the development of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). A recent review concluded that although there are contradictions in the literature, overall there is moderate evidence that TMD can occasionally follow whiplash injury, and that the incidence of this occurrence is low to moderate.[50]
 Whiplash is the term commonly used to describe hyperflexion and hyperextension,[51] and is one of the most common nonfatal car crash injuries. More than one million whiplash injuries occur each year due to car crashes. This is an estimate because not all cases of whiplash are reported. In a given year, an estimated 3.8 people per 1000 experience whiplash symptoms.[52] ""Freeman and co-investigators estimated that 6.2% of the US population have late whiplash syndrome"".[53] The majority of cases occur in patients in their late fourth decade. Unless a cervical strain has occurred with additional brain or spinal cord trauma mortality is rare.[52]
 Whiplash can occur at speeds of fifteen miles per hour or less; it is the sudden jolt, as one car hits another, that causes ones head to be abruptly thrown back and sideways. The more sudden the motion, the more bones, discs, muscles and tendons in ones neck and upper back will be damaged. Spinal cord injuries are responsible for about 6,000 deaths in the US each year and 5,000 whiplash injuries per year result in quadriplegia.[51]
 After 12 months, only 1 in 5 patients remain symptomatic, only 11.5% of individuals were able to return to work a year after the injury, and only 35.4% were able to get back to work at a similar level of performance after 20 years. Estimated indirect costs to industry are $66,626 per year, depending on the level and severity. Lastly, the total cost per year was $40.5 billion in 2008, a 317% increase over 1998.[51]
 Altogether it is of note that, especially in many Western countries, after a motor vehicle collision those involved seek health care for the assessment of injuries and for insurance documentation purposes. In contrast, in many less wealthy countries, there may be limited access to care and insurance may only be available to the wealthy. Against this background, the “(late) whiplash syndrome” (ICD-10: S13.4) has been one special focus of continuous and controversial scientific research since the 1950s [54][55] as the worldwide incidence of such injuries varies enormously, from 16-2000 per 100,000 population, and the late whiplash syndrome in these cases varies between 18% to 40%.[56] Thus, important work by Schrader et al. in The Lancet showed that late whiplash syndrome after a motor vehicle collision is rare or uncommon in Lithuania,[57] and Cassidy et al.’s conclusion in the New England Journal of Medicine is that “the elimination of compensation for pain and suffering is associated with a decreased incidence and improved prognosis of whiplash injury”.[58]
 Moreover, an experimental study in 2001 places participants in a stationary vehicle with a curtain blocking their rear view, and exposed them to a simulated rear-end collision. Twenty percent of patients had symptoms at 3 days, despite the fact that no collision actually occurred.[59]
 From the evolving viewpoint of naturalistic Internet search engine analytics in has been shown in 2017 that the expectations for receiving compensation may influence Internet search behavior in relation to whiplash injury.[60]

Sports injury,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Sports_injury,SI," Sports injuries are injuries that occur during sport, athletic activities, or exercising. In the United States, there are approximately 30 million teenagers and children combined who participate in some form of organized sport.[1] Of those, about three million athletes age 14 years and under experience a sports injury annually.[1] According to a study performed at Stanford University, 21 percent of the injuries observed in elite college athletes caused the athlete to miss at least one day of sport, and approximately 77 percent of these injuries involved the lower leg, ankle, or foot.[1] In addition to those sport injuries, the leading cause of death related to sports injuries is traumatic head or neck occurrences.[2] When an athlete complains of pain or an injury, the key to a diagnosis is to obtain a detailed history and examination. An example of a format used to guide an examination and treatment plan is a S.O.A.P note or, subjective, objective, assessment, plan. Another important aspect of sport injury is prevention, which helps to reduce potential sport injuries. It is important to establish sport-specific dynamic warm-ups, stretching, and exercises that can help prevent injuries common to each individual sport. Creating an injury prevention program also includes education on hydration, nutrition, monitoring team members “at risk”, monitoring at-risk behaviors, and improving technique. Season analysis reviews, preseason screenings, and pre-participation examinations are also essential in recognizing pre-existing conditions or previous injuries that could cause further illness or injury. One technique that can be used in the process of preseason screening is the functional movement screen. The functional movement screen can assess movement patterns in athletes in order to find players who are at risk of certain injuries.[3] In addition, prevention for adolescent athletes should be considered and may need to be applied differently than adult athletes. Lastly, following various research about sport injury, it is shown that levels of anxiety, stress, and depression are elevated when an athlete experiences an injury depending on the type and severity of the injury.[4]
 Nearly two million people every year suffer sports-related injuries and receive treatment in emergency departments.[5] Fatigue is a large contributing factor that results in many sport injuries. There are times where an athlete may participate on low energy leading to the deterioration in technique or form, resulting in a slower reaction time, loss in stability of muscle joints, and allowing an injury to occur. For both sexes the most common areas injured are the knee and ankle, with sprains/strains being the most common areas for injury. Injuries involving the patellofemoral articulation are significantly more frequent among females. The sport with the highest injury rate is football, with greater than 12 times the number of injuries seen in the next most common sport.[6]
 When soft tissue experiences trauma the dead and damaged cells release chemicals, which initiate an inflammatory response. The small blood vessels that are damaged become dilated which produce bleeding within the tissue. The body's normal response includes forming a small blood clot in order to stop the bleeding and allows a clot of special cells, called fibroblasts, to form. This begins the healing process by laying down scar tissue. Therefore, the inflammatory stage is the first phase of healing. However, too much of an inflammatory response in the early stage can indicate that the healing process takes longer and a return to activity is delayed.[7] Sports injury treatments are intended to minimize the inflammatory phase of an injury, so that the overall healing process is accelerated. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors are determinant for the healing process.[8]
 Soft tissue injuries can be generally grouped into three categories: contusions, abrasions and lacerations. Contusions or bruises are the simplest and most common soft tissue injury and is usually a result of blunt force trauma. Severe contusions may involve deeper structures and can include nerve or vascular injury. Abrasions are superficial injuries to the skin no deeper than the epidermis tissue layer, and bleeding, if present, is minimal. Minor abrasions generally do not scar, but deeper abrasions generally bleed and may scar. Lastly, sports-related lacerations are caused by blunt trauma and result in burst-type open wounds, often with jagged irregular edges. Facial lacerations are the most variable of the soft tissue injuries that athletes can sustain. They can occur intraorally and extraorally, vary from a superficial skin nick to a through and through lip laceration, or involve significant vascular disruption or injury to collateral vital structures.[9]
 Types of hard tissue injuries can include dental and bone injuries and are less frequent than soft tissue injuries in sport, but are often more serious.[10] Hard tissue injuries to teeth and bones can occur with contusions, such as Battle sign, which indicates basilar skull fracture, and so-called raccoon eyes, which indicate mid-face fractures.[11] However, tooth fractures are the most common type of tooth injury, and can be categorized as crown infractions, enamel-only fracture, enamel-dentin fractures, and fractures that extend through the enamel and dentin into the pulp which are defined below.[12]
 In addition to tooth fractures, there are several types of bone fractures as well. These types being closed or simple, open or compound, greenstick, hairline, complicated, comminuted, avulsion, and compression. A complicated fracture is when the structures surrounding the fracture are injured, such as blood vessels, organs, nerves, etc.[14]
 Overuse injuries can be defined as injuries that result from a mechanism of repetitive and cumulative micro-trauma, without a specific onset incident. Rapid changes in physical growth can make children vulnerable to overuse injuries, and these types of injuries are increasing among youth populations. Overuse injuries can usually be classified into 4 types/stages, these include:
 Predictive Indicators of Overuse Injuries in Adolescent Endurance Athletes, runners seem to account for the majority of injuries (up to 80 percent) with the majority of these injuries (more than two-thirds), occurring in the lower extremity and being of an overuse nature.[16] Although incidence rates in senior athletics has been reported as 3.9 injuries/1000 hours of practice, specific injury incidence in youth track and field varies among disciplines; whereas an overall incidence of 0.89 injuries/1000 hours has been reported for high school track and field athletes. In addition, long distance runners have showed a 19 times higher incidence (17 injuries/1000 hours) than other disciplines.[16]
 Head and neck injuries can include a variety of pathologies from sprains, strains and fractures to traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord injuries. Sprains and strains can occur from an abrupt rotation or whipping motion, such as whiplash.[17] Stress injuries (stress fractures and stress reactions) of the lumbosacral region are one of the causes of sports-related lower back pain in young individuals.[18] The onset of the observed cervical fractures in sports injury were likely due to continued momentum that transferred loads superiorly through the neck, which likely exacerbated the injuries the injuries to the occipital condyles and the upper cervical vertebrae.[19] Researchers have reported that 3-25% of cervical spine injuries actually occur after the initial traumatic event and are caused or exacerbated by improper handling during early stages of management or patient transport.[20] One of the more common head or neck injuries that occurs in sports is a concussion. A concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury resulting in a chemical change in the brain and has potential to cause damage to brain tissue. This can occur when a person sustains a hit or blow that cause the head and brain to move quickly, causing the brain to bounce in the skull.[21] According to an epidemiological study published in the Journal of Athletic Training, the incidence of concussions from 27 high school sports was 3.89 sports-related concussions per 10,000 athlete exposures.[22]
 There are several factors that may put an athlete more at risk for certain injuries than others. Intrinsic or personal factors that could put an athlete at higher risk for injury could be gender. For example, female athletes are typically more prone to injuries such as ACL tears. There are approximately 1.6-fold greater rate of ACL tears per athletic exposure in high school female athletes than males of the same age range.[23] Other intrinsic factors are age, weight/body composition, and height,[24] lack of flexibility or range of motion, coordination, balance, and endurance. In addition, biological factors such as pes planus, pes cavus, and valgus or varus knees that can cause an athlete to have improper biomechanics and become predisposed to injury.[25] There are also psychological factors that are included in intrinsic risk factors. Some psychological factors that could make certain individuals more subject to injury include personal stressors in their home, school, or social life. There are also extrinsic risk factors that can effect an athlete's risk of injury. Some examples of extrinsic factors would be sport specific protective equipment such as helmet, shoulder pads, mouth guards and shin guards, and whether or not these pieces of equipment are fitted correctly to the individual athlete to ensure that they are each preventing injury as well as possible. Other extrinsic factors are the conditions of the sport setting, such as rain, snow, and maintenance of the floor/field of playing surface.[26]
 
 Prevention helps reduce potential sport injuries and provides several benefits. Some benefits include a healthier athlete, longer duration of participation in the sport, potential for better performance, and reduced medical costs. Explaining the benefits to participate in sports injury prevention programs to coaches, team trainers, sports teams, and individual athletes will give them a glimpse at the likelihood for success by having the athletes feeling they are healthy, strong, comfortable, and capable to compete.
 Prevention can be broken up into three broad categories of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.[27] Primary prevention involves the avoidance of injury. An example is ankle braces being worn as a team, even those with no history of previous ankle injuries. If primary prevention activities were effective, there would be a lesser chance of injuries occurring in the first place. Secondary prevention involves an early diagnosis and treatment should be acquired once an injury has occurred. The goal of obtaining early diagnosis is to ensure that the injury is receiving proper care and recovering correctly, therefore limiting the concern for other medical problems to stem from the initial traumatic event. Lastly, tertiary prevention is solely focused on the rehabilitation to reduce and correct an existing disability resulting from the traumatic event. An example in the case of an athlete who has obtained an ankle injury the rehabilitation would consist of balance exercises to acquire the strength and mobility back as well as wearing an ankle brace, while gradually returning to the sport.
 It is most essential to establish participation in warm-ups, stretching, and exercises that focus on main muscle groups commonly used in the sport of interest. Participation in these events decreases the chances for getting muscle cramps, torn muscles, and stress fractures. A season analysis is one of the beneficial reviews for preventing player sport injuries. A season analysis is an attempt to identify risks before they occur by reviewing training methods, the competition schedule, traveling, and past injuries. If injuries have occurred in the past, the season analysis reviews the injury and looks for patterns to see if it may be related to a specific training event or competition program. For example, a stress fracture injury on a soccer team or cross country team may be correlated to a simultaneous increase in running and a change in running environment, like a transition from a soft to hard running surface. A season analysis can be documented as team-based results or individual athlete results. Other key program events that have been correlated to injury incidences are changes in training volume, changes in climate locations, selection for playing time in important matches, and poor sleep due to tight chaotic scheduling.[27] It is important for team program directors and staff to implicate testing in order to ensure healthy, competitive, and confident athletes for their upcoming season.
 Another beneficial review for preventing player sport injuries is preseason screenings. A study found that the highest injury rate during practices across fifteen Division I, II, and III NCAA sports was in the preseason compared to in-season or postseason.[28] To prepare an athlete for the wide range of activities needed to partake in their sport pre-participation examinations are regularly completed on hundreds of thousands of athletes each year. It is extremely important that the physical exam is done properly in order to limit the risks of injury and also to diagnose early onsets of a possible injury. Preseason screenings consist of testing the mobility of joints (ankles, wrists, hips, etc.), testing the stability of joints (knees, neck, etc.), testing the strength and power of muscles, and also testing breathing patterns. The objective of a preseason screening is to clear the athlete for participation and verify that there is no sign of injury or illness, which would represent a potential medical risk to the athlete (and risk of liability to the sports organization).[27] Besides the physical examination and the fluidity of the movements of joints the preseason screenings often takes into account a nutrition aspect as well. It is important to maintain normal iron levels, blood pressure levels, fluid balance, adequate total energy intake, and normal glycogen levels. Nutrition can aid in injury prevention and rehabilitation, if one obtains the body's daily intake needs. Obtaining sufficient amount of calories, carbohydrates, fluids, protein, and vitamins and minerals is important for the overall health of the athlete and limits the risk of possible injuries.[29] Iron deficiency, for example, is found in both male and female athletes; however 60 percent of female college athletes are affected by iron deficiency.[29] There are many factors that can contribute to the loss in iron, like menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding, inadequate iron intake from the diet, general fatigue, weakness, among others. The consequences of iron deficiency, if not solved, can be an impaired athletic performance and a decline in immune and cognitive function.[30]
 One technique used in the process of preseason screening is the functional movement screen (FMS). Functional movement screening is an assessment used to evaluate movement patterns and asymmetries, which can provide insight into mechanical restrictions and potential risk for injury. Functional movement screening contains seven fundamental movement patterns that require a balance of both mobility and stability. These fundamental movement patterns provide an observable performance of basic locomotor, manipulative, and stabilizing movements. The tests place the individual athlete in extreme positions where weaknesses and imbalances become clear if proper stability and mobility is not functioning correctly.[31] The seven fundamental movement patterns are a deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight-leg raise, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability. For example, the deep squat is a test that challenges total body mechanics. It is used to gauge bilateral, symmetrical, and functional mobility of the hips, knees, and ankles. The dowel held overhead gauges bilateral and symmetrical mobility of the shoulders and the thoracic spine. The ability to perform the deep squat technique requires appropriate pelvic rhythm, closed-kinetic chain dorsiflexion of the ankles, flexion of the knees and hips, extension of the thoracic spine, as well as flexion and abduction of the shoulders.[32] There is a scoring system applied to each movement as follows a score of 3 is given to the athlete if they can perform the movement without any compensations, a score of 2 is given to the athlete if they can perform the movement, but operate on poor mechanics and compensatory patterns to achieve the movement, a score of 1 is given to the athlete if they cannot perform the movement pattern even with compensations, and finally, a 0 is given to the athlete if one has pain during any part of the movement or test. Three of the seven fundamental tests including shoulder mobility, trunk stability push-up, and rotary stability have a clearance scoring associated with them meaning a pass or fail score. If the athlete fails this part of the test a score of 0 is given as the overall score. Once the scoring is complete the athlete and medical professional can review the documentation together and organize a set prevention program to help target and strengthen the areas of weakness in order to limit the risks of possible injuries.[31][33]
 There are approximately 8,000 children treated in emergency rooms each day for sports-related injures.[34] It is estimated that around 1.35 million kids will suffer a sports-related injury per year worldwide.[35] This is why children and adolescents need special attention and care when participating in sports.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), many sports-related injuries are predictable and preventable.[36] Some prevention techniques are listed below.
 Sports that have a higher incidence of contact and collision have the highest rates of injury.[39] Collisions with the ground, objects, and other players are common, and unexpected dynamic forces on limbs and joints can cause sports injuries. Soccer is the sport leading to most competitive injuries in NCAA female college athletes. Gymnastics, on the other hand, has the highest injury rate overall. Swimming and diving is the NCAA sport that has the lowest injury rates.[40] Injury rates were much higher for NCAA women's sports during competitions rather than practices except for volleyball, indoor track, and swimming and diving.[41] For eight of the NCAA sports, many injuries acquired during competition require at least seven days recovery before returning to the sport. In general, more females are injured during practice than in competition.[42] NCAA athlete injury rates are higher in men's ice hockey, basketball, and lacrosse.[43] NCAA athlete injury rates were significantly higher in women's cross country than men's cross country. [44] The NCAA injury rates are roughly the same for soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and both indoor and outdoor track and field, regardless of gender.[45]
 Interventions targeted at decreasing the incidence of sports injuries can impact health-care costs, as well as family and societal resources.[46] Sports injuries have direct and indirect costs. The direct costs are usually calculated by taking into account the cost of using healthcare resources to prevent, detect and treat injury. There is a need for research about how healthcare is used and the expenses that coincide with it. Included in these expenses are how different injuries may have different prognoses. Indirect costs may be taken into account as well, when an injury prevents an individual from returning to work it may hinder the economic benefit to themselves and others.[47]
 For collegiate athletics, the estimated cost of sport injuries ranges from $446 million to $1.5 billion dollars per year.[48] For high school athletics, the yearly estimated cost of sport injuries ranges from $5.4 billion to $19.2 billion.[49] Medical costs in the United States for sports injury related emergency department visits exceeded $935 million dollars every year.[50]
 Sport involvement can initiate both physical and mental demands on athletes. Athletes must learn ways to cope with stressors and frustrations that can arise from competition against others. Conducted research shows that levels of anxiety, stress, and depression are elevated following sports injuries.[51]  After an occurrence of an injury many athletes display self-esteem issues, athletic identity crises, and high levels of post-traumatic distress, which are linked to avoidant coping skills.[51][52]

Achilles tendon rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Achilles_tendon_rupture,SI," Achilles tendon rupture is when the Achilles tendon, at the back of the ankle, breaks.[5] Symptoms include the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel.[3] A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking becomes difficult.[4]
 Rupture typically occurs as a result of a sudden bending up of the foot when the calf muscle is engaged, direct trauma, or long-standing tendonitis.[4][5] Other risk factors include the use of fluoroquinolones, a significant change in exercise, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or corticosteroid use.[1][5] Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and examination and supported by medical imaging.[5]
 Prevention may include stretching before activity.[4] Treatment may be by surgery or casting with the toes somewhat pointed down.[6][5][2] Relatively rapid return to weight bearing (within 4 weeks) appears okay.[6][7] The risk of re-rupture is about 25% with casting.[5] If appropriate treatment does not occur within 4 weeks of the injury outcomes are not as good.[8]
 Achilles tendon rupture occurs in about 1 per 10,000 people per year.[5] Males are more commonly affected than females.[1] People in their 30s to 50s are most commonly affected.[5] The tendon itself was named in 1693 after the Greek hero Achilles.[9]
 The main symptoms is typically the sudden onset of sharp pain in the heel.[3] A snapping sound may be heard as the tendon breaks and walking then becomes difficult.[4]
 The Achilles tendon is most commonly injured by sudden plantarflexion or dorsiflexion of the ankle, or by forced dorsiflexion of the ankle outside its normal range of motion.[citation needed]
 Other mechanisms by which the Achilles can be torn involve sudden direct trauma to the tendon, or sudden activation of the Achilles after atrophy from prolonged periods of inactivity. Some other common tears can occur from overuse while participating in intense sports. Twisting or jerking motions can also contribute to injury.[citation needed]
 Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, famously ciprofloxacin, are known to increase the risk of tendon rupture, particularly Achilles.[citation needed]
 People who commonly fall victim to Achilles rupture or tear include recreational athletes, people of old age, individuals with previous Achilles tendon tears or ruptures, previous tendon injections or quinolone use, extreme changes in training intensity or activity level, and participation in a new activity.[citation needed]
 Most cases of Achilles tendon rupture are traumatic sports injuries. The average age of patients is 29–40 years with a male-to-female ratio of nearly 20:1.  Direct steroid injections into the tendon have also been linked to rupture.
 The use of quinolone antibiotics can cause several forms of tendinitis and tendon rupture, including rupture of the Achilles tendon.  The risk is higher in people who are older than 60, who are also taking corticosteroids, or have kidney disease; it also increases with dose and taking them for longer periods of time. As of 2016 the mechanism through which quinolones cause this, was unclear.[10]
 The Achilles tendon is the strongest and thickest tendon in the body, connecting the gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris to the calcaneus. It is approximately 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) long and begins near the middle portion of the calf. Contraction of the gastrosoleus plantar flexes the foot, enabling such activities as walking, jumping, and running. The Achilles tendon receives its blood supply from its musculotendinous junction with the triceps surae and its innervation from the sural nerve and to a lesser degree from the tibial nerve.[citation needed]
 Diagnosis may be based on symptoms and the history of the event; typically people say it feels like being kicked or shot behind the ankle. Upon examination a gap may be felt just above the heel unless swelling has filled the gap and the Simmonds' test (aka Thompson test) will be positive; squeezing the calf muscles of the affected side while the person lies on their stomach, face down, with his feet hanging loose results in no movement (no passive plantarflexion) of the foot, while movement is expected with an intact Achilles tendon and should be observable upon manipulation of the uninvolved calf. Walking will usually be severely impaired, as the person will be unable to step off the ground using the injured leg. The person will also be unable to stand up on the toes of that leg, and pointing the foot downward (plantarflexion) will be impaired. Pain may be severe, and swelling is common.[citation needed]
 Sometimes an ultrasound scan may be required to clarify or confirm the diagnosis and is recommended over MRI.[11] MRI is generally not needed.[12]
 Musculoskeletal ultrasonography can be used to determine the tendon thickness, character, and presence of a tear. It works by sending extremely high frequencies of sound through the body. Some of these sounds are reflected back off the spaces between interstitial fluid and soft tissue or bone. These reflected images can be analyzed and computed into an image. These images are captured in real time and can be very helpful in detecting movement of the tendon and visualising possible injuries or tears. This device makes it very easy to spot structural damages to soft tissues, and consistent method of detecting this type of injury. This imaging modality is inexpensive, involves no ionizing radiation and, in the hands of skilled ultrasonographers, may be very reliable.
 MRI can be used to discern incomplete ruptures from degeneration of the Achilles tendon, and MRI can also distinguish between paratenonitis, tendinosis, and bursitis. This technique uses a strong uniform magnetic field to align millions of protons running through the body. These protons are then bombarded with radio waves that knock some of them out of alignment.  When these protons return they emit their own unique radio waves that can be analysed by a computer in 3D to create sharp cross sectional image of the area of interest. MRI can provide unparalleled contrast in soft tissue for an extremely high quality photograph making it easy for technicians to spot tears and other injuries.[citation needed]
 Radiography can also be used to indirectly identify Achilles tears. Radiography uses X-rays to analyse the point of injury. This is not very effective at identifying injuries to soft tissue. X-rays are created when high energy electrons hit a metal source. X-ray images are acquired by utilising the different attenuation characteristics of dense (e.g. calcium in bone) and less dense (e.g. muscle) tissues when these rays pass through tissue and are captured on film. X-rays are generally exposed to optimise visualisation of dense objects such as bone while soft tissue remains relatively undifferentiated in the background. Radiography has little role in assessment of Achilles' tendon injury and is more useful for ruling out other injuries such as calcaneal fractures.[13]
 Treatment options for an Achilles tendon rupture include surgical and non-surgical approaches.[2] While surgery has a lower risk of future rupture it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches.[2]
 Non-surgical management traditionally was selected for minor ruptures, less active patients, and those with medical conditions that prevent them from undergoing surgery. It traditionally consisted of restriction in a plaster cast for six to eight weeks with the foot pointed downwards (to oppose the ends of the ruptured tendon). But recent studies have produced superior results with much more rapid rehabilitation in fixed or hinged boots.[citation needed]
 Some surgeons feel an early surgical repair of the tendon is beneficial. The surgical option was long thought to offer a significantly smaller risk of re-rupture compared to traditional non-operative management (5% vs 15%).[14] Of course, surgery imposes higher risks of infection and bleeding.
 However, three recent studies have scientifically tested the benefits of surgery, using randomized streaming of patients into surgical and non-surgical protocols, and applying virtually identical (and aggressive) rehabilitation protocols to both types of patients. None of the three studies found statistically significant benefits from the surgery, separated from the other confounding variables. They all produced reasonably comparable results in re-rupture rates (with each study adding a cautious note about small sample size, one study showing 12% re-rupture in non-surgical treatment versus 4% re-rupture in surgical treatment, which is statistically insignificant), strength, and range of motion, while most have reaffirmed the greater complication rate from surgery.  Although the study met the sample size dictated by the authors’ a priori power calculation, the difference in the rerupture rate might be considered clinically important by some.[15][16][17][18]  Two studies showed small, but statistically significant differences in plantarflexion strength: The surgical group had significantly better results in the heel-rise work, heel-rise height, concentric power, and hopping tests at the 6-month evaluation than did the nonsurgical group. However, at the 12-month evaluation, there was a significant between-groups difference only in one test, the heel-rise work test.[18][19]
 The relative benefits of surgical and nonsurgical treatments remains a subject of debate; authors of studies are cautious about the preferred treatment.[19] In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates.[20]
 There are two different types of surgeries; open surgery and percutaneous surgery.
 During an open surgery an incision is made in the back of the leg and the Achilles tendon is stitched together. In a complete or serious rupture the tendon of plantaris or another vestigial muscle is harvested and wrapped around the Achilles tendon, increasing the strength of the repaired tendon.[21] If the tissue quality is poor, e.g. the injury has been neglected, the surgeon might use a reinforcement mesh (collagen, Artelon or other degradable material).
 In percutaneous surgery, the surgeon makes several small incisions, rather than one large incision, and sews the tendon back together through the incision(s). Surgery may be delayed for about a week after the rupture to let the swelling go down.[22] For sedentary patients and those who have vasculopathy or risks for poor healing, percutaneous surgical repair may be a better treatment choice than open surgical repair.[23]
 Non-surgical treatment used to involve very long periods in a series of casts, and took longer to complete than surgical treatment. But both surgical and non-surgical rehabilitation protocols have recently become quicker, shorter, more aggressive, and more successful. It used to be that patients who underwent surgery would wear a cast for approximately 4 to 8 weeks after surgery and were only allowed to gently move the ankle once out of the cast. Recent studies have shown that patients have quicker and more successful recoveries when they are allowed to move and lightly stretch their ankle immediately after surgery. To keep their ankle safe these patients use a removable boot while walking and doing daily activities. Modern studies including non-surgical patients generally limit non-weight-bearing (NWB) to two weeks, and use modern removable boots, either fixed or hinged, rather than casts. Physiotherapy is often begun as early as two weeks following the start of either kind of treatment.[citation needed]
 There are three things that need to be kept in mind while rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles: range of motion, functional strength, and sometimes orthotic support. Range of motion is important because it takes into mind the tightness of the repaired tendon. When beginning rehab a patient should perform stretches lightly and increase the intensity as time and pain permits. Putting linear stress on the tendon is important because it stimulates connective tissue repair, which can be achieved while performing the “runners stretch,” (putting your toes a couple inches up the wall while your heel is on the ground). Doing stretches to gain functional strength are also important because it improves healing in the tendon, which will in turn lead to a quicker return to activities. These stretches should be more intense and should involve some sort of weight bearing, which helps reorient and strengthen the collagen fibers in the injured ankle. A popular stretch used for this phase of rehabilitation is the toe raise on an elevated surface. The patient is to push up onto the toes and lower his or her self as far down as possible and repeat several times. The other part of the rehab process is orthotic support. This doesn’t have anything to do with stretching or strengthening the tendon, rather it is in place to keep the patient comfortable. These are custom made inserts that fit into the patients shoe and help with proper pronation of the foot, which is otherwise a problem that can lead to problems with the Achilles.[citation needed]
 To briefly summarize the steps of rehabilitating a ruptured Achilles tendon, you should begin with range of motion type stretching. This will allow the ankle to get used to moving again and get ready for weight bearing activities. Then there is functional strength, this is where weight bearing should begin in order to start strengthening the tendon and getting it ready to perform daily activities and eventually in athletic situations.[24][25]
"
Biceps tendon rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Biceps_tendon_rupture,SI," A biceps tendon rupture is a complete or partial rupture of a tendon of the biceps brachii muscle. It can affect the distal tendon, or either/both of the proximal tendons, attached to the long and short head of the muscle, respectively.
 A biceps tendon rupture may occur during athletic activities, however avulsion injuries of the distal biceps tendon are frequently occupational in nature and sustained during forceful, eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle while lifting.[1]
 Acute rupture of the distal biceps tendon can be treated nonoperatively with acceptable results,[2] but because the injury can lead to 30% loss of elbow flexion strength and 30-50% loss of forearm supination strength, surgical repair is generally recommended.[3][4][5] Complete distal biceps tears are commonly treated with re-attachment of the biceps tendon to its native insertion on the tuberosity of the radius using bone tunnels, suture buttons, or suture anchors.[6][3][7]  Proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon can be surgically addressed by two different techniques. Biceps tenodesis includes release of the long head of the biceps tendon off of its insertion on the glenoid and re-attachment by screw or suture anchor fixation to the humerus. Biceps tenotomy consists of simple release of the long head of the biceps without reattachment to the humerus, allowing the tendon to retract into the soft tissues of the proximal upper arm.[1] Degeneration of the tendon can cause partial tears and are rarely associated with a traumatic event. 
 Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury.  In most cases, the muscle will heal over time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery.[8]

Boxer's fracture,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Boxer%27s_fracture,SI," A boxer's fracture is the break of the 5th metacarpal bones of the hand near the knuckle.[4] Occasionally it is used to refer to fractures of the 4th metacarpal as well.[1] Symptoms include pain and a depressed knuckle.[2]
 Classically, it occurs after a person hits an object with a closed fist.[3] The knuckle is then bent towards the palm of the hand.[3] Diagnosis is generally suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with X-rays.[3]
 For most fractures with less than 70 degrees of angulation, buddy taping and a tensor bandage resulted in similar outcomes to reduction with splinting.[4] In those with more than 70 degrees of angulation or in which the broken finger is rotated, reduction and splitting may be recommended.[3]
 They represent about a fifth of hand fractures.[4] They occur more commonly in males than females.[4] Both short and long term outcomes are generally good.[4] The knuckle, however, typically remains somewhat deformed.[5]
 The symptoms are pain and tenderness in the specific location of the hand, which corresponds to the metacarpal bone around the knuckle. When a fracture occurs, there may be a snapping or popping sensation. There will be swelling of the hand along with discoloration or bruising in the affected area. Abrasions or lacerations of the hand are also likely to occur. The respective finger may be misaligned, and movement of that finger may be limited and painful.
 Metacarpal fractures are usually caused by the impact of a clenched fist with a hard, immovable object, such as a skull or a wall.[6] When a punch impacts with improper form, the force occurs at an angle towards the palm, creating a dorsal bend in the bone, ultimately causing the fracture when the bone is bent too far.
 When a boxer punches with proper form, the knuckles of the second and third metacarpal align linearly with the articulating radius, followed linearly by the humerus. Due to the linear articulation of bones, the force is able to travel freely across these joints and bones and be dissipated without injury. Therefore, fractures of the second or third metacarpals are rare, with fractures of the 4th and 5th metacarpals comprising the vast majority of metacarpal fractures.[7]
 Diagnosis by a doctor’s examination is the most common, often confirmed by x-rays. X-ray is used to display the fracture and the angulations of the fracture. A CT scan may be done in very rare cases to provide a more detailed picture.
 Boxers and other combat athletes routinely use hand wraps and boxing gloves to help stabilize the hand, greatly reducing pain and risk of injury during impact. Proper punching form is the most important factor to prevent this type of fracture.
 Ice is applied to relieve pain and swelling. Any open wounds are cleansed to avoid infection.
 For most fractures with less than 70 degrees of angulation, buddy taping and a tensor bandage resulted in similar outcomes to reduction with splinting.[4]
 In rare cases surgery may be required to place pins or plates in the bone to hold the pieces in place.[8]
 Prognosis for these fractures is generally good, with total healing time not exceeding 12 weeks. The first two weeks will show significantly reduced overall swelling, with improvement in clenching ability showing up first. Ability to extend the fingers in all directions appears to improve more slowly. Hard casts are rarely required, and soft casts or splints can be removed for brief periods of time to allow for cleaning and drying the skin underneath the splint.[9] Pain from injury varies person to person as with most injuries cannot in all honesty be generalized. Depending on the individual a course of over the counter or narcotic pain medication will suffice. Muscle atrophy of 5 to 15 percent may be expected, with a rehabilitation period of approximately 4 months given adequate therapy. In the mildest of cases, full rehabilitation status can be achieved within 3 to 4 months.
 Hand and wrist injuries are reported to account for fifteen to twenty percent of emergency room injuries, and metacarpal fractures represent a significant number of those injuries. Hand injuries of this sort are most prevalent among fifteen- to thirty-five-year-old males, and the fifth metacarpal is the one most commonly affected.[10]
 Males are nearly fifty percent more likely to sustain fracture from a punch mechanism than females. Male intentional punch injuries are correlated predominantly with social deprivation, while female punch intentional injuries show more correlation with psychiatric disorders.[11]
 Approximately 3.7 male hand injuries, per 1000, per year, and 1.3 female hand injuries, per 1000, per year, have been reported. Common mechanisms of injury are gender specific. Although the fiscal cost is not available, it can be asserted that the cost is reasonably significant per individual, depending on the cost of emergency care, immobilization, surgery, follow up doctors’ visits, etc. in addition to the fiscal impact from loss of and/or limited work abilities.
 As these are colloquial terms, texts and medical dictionaries do not universally agree on precise meanings. Various authorities state that a ""boxer's fracture"" means a break in specifically the second metacarpal bone or third metacarpal bone,[12] with ""bar room fracture"" being specific to the fourth metacarpal bone or fifth metacarpal bone.[13] Though some writers assert that boxer's fracture and bar room fracture are distinct terms representing injuries to different bones, this distinction seems to have been lost and most medical professionals now describe any metacarpal fracture as a ""boxer's fracture"" .

Cauliflower ear,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Cauliflower_ear,SI," Cauliflower ear is an irreversible condition that occurs when the external portion of the ear is hit and develops a blood clot or other collection of fluid under the perichondrium. This separates the cartilage from the overlying perichondrium that supplies its nutrients, causing it to die and resulting in the formation of fibrous tissue in the overlying skin. As a result, the outer ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower.
 The condition is common in martial arts such as BJJ, judo, mixed martial arts, or wrestling, and in full-contact sports such as rugby union and rugby league.
 People presenting with possible auricular hematoma often have additional, more impressive injuries (e.g. head/neck lacerations) due to the frequently-traumatic causes of auricular hematoma. The ear itself is often tense, fluctuant, and tender with throbbing pain. However, because of potentially more remarkable injuries often associated with auricular hematoma, auricular hematoma can easily be overlooked without directed attention.[1]
 The most common cause of cauliflower ear is blunt trauma to the ear leading to a hematoma which, if left untreated, eventually heals to give the distinct appearance of cauliflower ear. The structure of the ear is supported by a cartilaginous scaffold consisting of the following distinct components: the helix, antihelix, concha, tragus, and antitragus.[1] The skin that covers this cartilage is extremely thin with virtually no subcutaneous fat while also strongly attached to the perichondrium, which is richly vascularized to supply the avascular cartilage.[1]
 Cauliflower can also present in the setting of nontraumatic inflammatory injury of auricular connective tissue such as in relapsing polychondritis (RP), a rare rheumatologic disorder in which recurrent episodes of inflammation result in destruction of cartilage of the ears and nose.[2] Joints, eyes, audiovestibular system, cardiovascular system, and respiratory tract can also be involved.[2]
 The components of the ear involved in cauliflower ear are the outer skin, the perichondrium, and the cartilage.[3] The outer ear skin is tightly adherent to the perichondrium because there is almost no subcutaneous fat on the anterior of the ear.[3] This leaves the perichondrium relatively exposed to damage from direct trauma and shear forces, created by a force pushing across the ear like a punch, and increasing the risk of hematoma formation.[3] In an auricular hematoma, blood accumulates between the perichondrium and cartilage. The hematoma mechanically obstructs blood flow from the perichondrium to the avascular cartilage.[1] This lack of perfusion puts the cartilage at risk for becoming necrotic and/or infected.[1] If left untreated, disorganized fibrosis and cartilage formation will occur around the aforementioned cartilaginous components.[1]
 Consequently, the concave pinna fills with disorganized connective tissue.[1] The cartilage then deforms and kinks, resulting in the distinctive appearance somewhat resembling a cauliflower.[1] Rapid evacuation of the hematoma restores close contact between the cartilage and perichondrium, thereby reducing the likelihood of deformity by minimizing the ischemia that would otherwise result from a remaining hematoma.[1]
 Auricular hematoma most often occurs in the potential space between the helix and the antihelix (scapha) and extends anteriorly into the fossa triangularis.[1] Less frequently, the hematoma may form in the concha or the area in and around the external auditory meatus.[1] Importantly, an auricular hematoma can also occur on the posterior ear surface, or even both surfaces.[1] Risk of necrotic tissue is greatest when both posterior and anterior surfaces are involved, although posterior surface involvement is less likely given its increased quantity of impact-dampening subcutaneous tissue.[1][3]
 Perichondral hematoma and consequently cauliflower ear are diagnosed clinically. This means that the medical provider will make the diagnosis by using elements of the history of the injury (examples: participation in contact sports, trauma to the ear, previous similar episodes) and combine this with findings on physical exam (examples: tenderness to the area, bruising, deformation of the ear contours) to confirm the diagnosis and decide on the appropriate treatment for the patient.[3]
 To assist with settling on the best form of treatment for cauliflower ear Yotsuyianagi et al. created a classification system for deciding when surgery is needed and to guide the best approach.[4]
 Headgear called a ""scrum cap"" in rugby, or simply ""headgear"" or ear guard in wrestling and other martial arts, that protects the ears is worn to help prevent this condition. A specialty ear splint can also be made to keep the ear compressed, so that the damaged ear is unable to fill thus preventing cauliflower ear. For some athletes, however, a cauliflower ear is considered a badge of courage or experience.[5]
 There are many types of treatment for the perichondral hematoma that can lead to cauliflower ear, but the current body of research is unable to identify a single best treatment or protocol.[6] There is definitive evidence that the drainage of this hematoma is better for the prevention of cauliflower deformity when compared to conservative treatment, but the use of bandages and/or splinting after drainage requires more research.[6]
 Because an acute hematoma can lead to cauliflower ear, prompt evacuation of the blood can prevent permanent deformity.[7]  There are many described techniques for the drainage of blood in the acute stage to prevent hematoma, including simple needle drainage, continuous suction devices, placing a wick, and incision and drainage.[3] After the blood has been drained the prevention of re-accumulation becomes the most pressing issue, this has been achieved with many techniques including: direct pressure dressings, in and out mattress sutures, buttons placed on sutures, thermoplastic splints, sutured cotton balls, and absorbable mattress sutures.[3] The use of simple drainage becomes less useful after six hours from the injury and when there is recurrent trauma. In these cases it has been suggested that open surgical treatment is more effective in returning the cosmetic appearance and prevention of recurrence.[3] The outer ear is prone to infections, so antibiotics are usually prescribed.[3] Pressure can be applied by bandaging which helps the skin and the cartilage to reconnect. Clothes pegs and magnets can also be used to ensure adequate pressure is applied to the damaged area[8]  Without medical intervention the ear can suffer serious damage. Disruption of the ear canal is possible. The outer ear may wrinkle and can become slightly pale due to reduced blood flow; hence the common term ""cauliflower ear"".[9] Cosmetic procedures are available that can possibly improve the appearance of the ear.[10]
 The presentation of cauliflower ear was first recorded in ancient Greece. Classically, it is seen in boxers, rugby players, and other athletes.[11][12] It has been seen in piano movers due to pressure on the ear when lifting pianos, and in some mentally ill and elderly. In Hong Kong opium dens, opium users would develop cauliflower ear from long periods sleeping on hard wooden pillows.[12]

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy,SI," Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries.[1] Symptoms may include behavioral problems, mood problems, and problems with thinking.[1] Symptoms typically do not begin until years after the injuries.[2] CTE often gets worse over time and can result in dementia.[2] It is unclear if the risk of suicide is altered.[1]
 Most documented cases have occurred in athletes involved in contact sports such as boxing, American football, professional wrestling, ice hockey, rugby and soccer.[1][4] Other risk factors include being in the military, prior domestic violence, and repeated banging of the head.[1] The exact amount of trauma required for the condition to occur is unknown.[1] Definitive diagnosis can only occur at autopsy.[1] Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a form of tauopathy.[1]
 There is no specific treatment.[3] Rates of disease have been found to be about 30% among those with a history of multiple head injuries.[1] Population rates, however, are unclear.[2] Research in brain damage as a result of repeated head injuries began in the 1920s, at which time the condition was known as dementia pugilistica or ""punch drunk syndrome"".[1][3] Changing the rules in some sports has been discussed as a means of prevention.[1]
 Symptoms of CTE, which occur in four stages, generally appear eight to ten years after an individual experiences repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries.[5]
 First-stage symptoms include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as confusion, disorientation, dizziness, and headaches. Second-stage symptoms include memory loss, social instability, impulsive behavior, and poor judgment. Third and fourth stages include progressive dementia, movement disorders, hypomimia, speech impediments, sensory processing disorder, tremors, vertigo, deafness, depression and suicidality.
 Additional symptoms include dysarthria, dysphagia, cognitive disorders such as amnesia, and ocular abnormalities, such as ptosis.[6]
 The condition manifests as dementia, or declining mental ability, problems with memory, dizzy spells or lack of balance to the point of not being able to walk under one's own power for a short time and/or Parkinsonism, or tremors and lack of coordination. It can also cause speech problems and an unsteady gait. Patients with CTE may be prone to inappropriate or explosive behavior and may display pathological jealousy or paranoia.[7]
 Most documented cases have occurred in athletes with mild repetitive brain trauma (RBT) over an extended period of time. Specifically contact sports such as boxing, American football, wrestling, ice hockey, rugby, and soccer.[1][4] Other potential risk factors include military personnel (repeated exposure to concussions charges or large caliber ordnance), domestic violence, and repeated banging of the head.[1] The exact amount of trauma required for the condition to occur is unknown.[1]
 The neuropathological appearance of CTE is distinguished from other tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease. The four clinical stages of observable CTE disability have been correlated with tau pathology in brain tissue, ranging in severity from focal perivascular epicenters of neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal neocortex to severe tauopathy affecting widespread brain regions.[8]
 The primary physical manifestations of CTE include a reduction in brain weight, associated with atrophy of the frontal and temporal cortices and medial temporal lobe. The lateral ventricles and the third ventricle are often enlarged, with rare instances of dilation of the fourth ventricle.[9] Other physical manifestations of CTE include anterior cavum septi pellucidi and posterior fenestrations, pallor of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, and atrophy of the olfactory bulbs, thalamus, mammillary bodies, brainstem and cerebellum.[10] As CTE progresses, there may be marked atrophy of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala.[5]
 On a microscopic scale, the pathology includes neuronal loss, tau deposition, TAR DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP 43)[8] deposition, white matter changes, and other abnormalities. The tau deposition occurs as dense neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neurites, and glial tangles, which are made up of astrocytes and other glial cells[9] Beta-amyloid deposition is a relatively uncommon feature of CTE.
 A small group of individuals with CTE have chronic traumatic encephalomyopathy (CTEM), which is characterized by symptoms of motor-neuron disease and which mimics amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Progressive muscle weakness and balance and gait problems (problems with walking) seem to be early signs of CTEM.[9]
 Exosome vesicles created by the brain are potential biomarkers of TBI, including CTE.[11] A subtype of CTE is dementia pugilistica or boxer's dementia (from Latin pugilator - boxer) as it was initially found in those with a history of boxing, also called ""punch-drunk syndrome"".
 Loss of neurons, scarring of brain tissue, collection of proteinaceous, senile plaques, hydrocephalus, attenuation of the corpus callosum, diffuse axonal injury, neurofibrillary tangles, and damage to the cerebellum are implicated in the syndrome. The condition may be etiologically related to Alzheimer's disease.[12] Neurofibrillary tangles have been found in the brains of dementia pugilistica patients, but not in the same distribution as is usually found in people with Alzheimer's.[13] One group examined slices of brain from patients having had multiple mild traumatic brain injuries and found changes in the cells' cytoskeletons, which they suggested might be due to damage to cerebral blood vessels.[14]
 Increased exposure to concussions and sub-concussive blows is regarded as the most important risk factor, which can depend on the total number of fights, number of knockout losses, the duration of career, fight frequency, age of retirement, and boxing style.[15]
 Currently, CTE can only be definitively diagnosed by direct tissue examination after death, including full and immunohistochemical brain analyses.[16] Abnormal p-tau accumulation in ""neurons, astrocytes, and cell processes in an irregular pattern at the depths of the cortical sulci"" is the most specific feature of CTE and required for pathological diagnosis.[17][18]
 The lack of distinct biomarkers is the reason CTE cannot typically be diagnosed while a person is alive. Concussions are non-structural injuries and do not result in brain bleeding, which is why most concussions cannot be seen on routine neuroimaging tests such as CT or MRI.[19] Acute concussion symptoms (those that occur shortly after an injury) should not be confused with CTE. Differentiating between prolonged post-concussion syndrome (PCS, where symptoms begin shortly after a concussion and last for weeks, months, and sometimes even years) and CTE symptoms can be difficult. Research studies are currently examining whether neuroimaging can detect subtle changes in axonal integrity and structural lesions that can occur in CTE.[5] Recently, more progress in in-vivo diagnostic techniques for CTE has been made, using DTI, fMRI, MRI, and MRS imaging; however, more research needs to be done before any such techniques can be validated.[9]
 PET tracers that bind specifically to tau protein are desired to aid diagnosis of CTE in living individuals. One candidate is the tracer [18F]FDDNP, which is retained in the brain in individuals with a number of dementing disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, familial frontotemporal dementia, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.[20] In a small study of 5 retired NFL players with cognitive and mood symptoms, the PET scans revealed accumulation of the tracer in their brains.[21] However, [18F]FDDNP binds to beta-amyloid and other proteins as well. Moreover, the sites in the brain where the tracer was retained were not consistent with the known neuropathology of CTE.[22]  A more promising candidate is the tracer [18F]-T807, which binds only to tau. It is being tested in several clinical trials.[22]
 A putative biomarker for CTE is the presence in serum of autoantibodies against the brain. The autoantibodies were detected in football players who experienced a large number of head hits but no concussions, suggesting that even sub-concussive episodes may be damaging to the brain. The autoantibodies may enter the brain by means of a disrupted blood-brain barrier, and attack neuronal cells which are normally protected from an immune onslaught.[23] Given the large numbers of neurons present in the brain (86 billion), and considering the poor penetration of antibodies across a normal blood-brain barrier, there is an extended period of time between the initial events (head hits) and the development of any signs or symptoms. Nevertheless, autoimmune changes in blood of players may consist the earliest measurable event predicting CTE.[24]
 Robert A. Stern, one of the scientists at the Boston University CTE Center,[25] said in 2015 that ""he expected a test to be developed within a decade that will be able to diagnose C.T.E. in living people"".[26]
 Investigators have demonstrated that immobilizing the head during a blast exposure prevented the learning and memory deficits associated with CTE that occurred when the head was not immobilized. This research represents the first case series of postmortem brains from U.S. military personnel who were exposed to a blast and/or a concussive injury.[27]
 Because of the concern that boxing may cause CTE, there is a movement among medical professionals to ban the sport.[7]  Medical professionals have called for such a ban since as early as the 1950s.[28]
 There is currently no cure[3] and it is not expected anytime soon.[29] Treatment is supportive as with other forms of dementia.[30]
 Rates of disease have been found to be about 30% among those with a history of multiple head injuries.[1] Population rates, however, are unclear.[2]
 Professional level athletes are the largest group with CTE, due to frequent concussions and sub-concussive impacts from play in contact sport.[31] These contact-sports include American football, ice hockey, rugby,[32] boxing, mixed martial arts, association football,[33][32] and wrestling.[34] In soccer, only prolific headers are known to have developed CTE.[33]
 Other individuals diagnosed with CTE were involved in military service, had a previous history of chronic seizures, were domestically abused, and or were involved in activities resulting in repetitive head collisions.[35]
 CTE was originally studied in boxers in the 1920s as dementia pugilistica. DP was first described in 1928 by a forensic pathologist, Dr. Harrison Stanford Martland, who was the chief medical examiner of Essex County in Newark, New Jersey in a Journal of the American Medical Association article, in which he noted the tremors, slowed movement, confusion, and speech problems typical of the condition.[36]
 The seminal work on the disease came from British neurologist Macdonald Critchley, who in 1949 wrote a paper titled ""Punch-drunk syndromes: the chronic traumatic encephalopathy of boxers.""[37] CTE was first recognized as affecting individuals who took considerable blows to the head, but was believed to be confined to boxers and not other athletes. As evidence pertaining to the clinical and neuropathological consequences of repeated mild head trauma grew, it became clear that this pattern of neurodegeneration was not restricted to boxers, and the term chronic traumatic encephalopathy became most widely used.[38][39] In the early 2000s, Nigerian-American neuropathologist Bennet Omalu worked on the case of American football player Mike Webster, who died following unusual and unexplained behavior. In 2005 Omalu, along with colleagues in the Department of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh, published his findings in the journal Neurosurgery in a paper which he titled ""Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a National Football League Player."" This was followed by a paper on a second case in 2006 describing similar pathology.
 In 2008, the Sports Legacy Institute joined with the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) to form the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE).[40] Brain Injury Research Institute (BIRI) also studies the impact of concussions.[41][42]
 The word pugilistica is derived from the Latin word pugil ‘boxer’ (akin to pugnus  ‘fist’, pugnāre  ‘to fight’).[43][44]
 It is also called chronic boxer's encephalopathy, traumatic boxer’s encephalopathy, boxer's dementia, pugilistic dementia, chronic traumatic brain injury associated with boxing (CTBI-B), and punch-drunk syndrome.[3] DP has historically been considered equivalent to CTE.[3]
 In 2005 forensic pathologist Bennet Omalu, along with colleagues in the Department of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh, published a paper, ""Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a National Football League Player"", in the journal Neurosurgery, based on analysis of the brain of deceased former NFL center Mike Webster. This was then followed by a paper on a second case in 2006 describing similar pathology, based on findings in the brain of former NFL player Terry Long.
 In 2008, the CSTE at Boston University at the BU School of Medicine started the CSTE brain bank at the Bedford VA Hospital to analyze the effects of CTE and other neurodegenerative diseases on the brain and spinal cord of athletes, military veterans, and civilians[8] To date, the CSTE Brain Bank is the largest CTE tissue repository in the world.[9]
On December 21, 2009, the National Football League Players Association announced that it would collaborate with the CSTE at the Boston University School of Medicine to support the Center's study of repetitive brain trauma in athletes.[45] Additionally, in 2010 the National Football League gave the CSTE a $1 million gift with no strings attached.[46][47] In 2008, twelve living athletes (active and retired), including hockey players Pat LaFontaine and Noah Welch as well as former NFL star Ted Johnson, committed to donate their brains to CSTE after their deaths.[40][48] In 2009, NFL Pro Bowlers Matt Birk, Lofa Tatupu, and Sean Morey pledged to donate their brains to the CSTE.[49] In 2010, 20 more NFL players and former players pledged to join the CSTE Brain Donation Registry, including Chicago Bears linebacker Hunter Hillenmeyer, Hall of Famer Mike Haynes, Pro Bowlers Zach Thomas, Kyle Turley, and Conrad Dobler, Super Bowl Champion Don Hasselbeck and former pro players Lew Carpenter, and Todd Hendricks. In 2010, Professional Wrestlers Mick Foley, Booker T and Matt Morgan also agreed to donate their brains upon their deaths. Also in 2010, MLS player Taylor Twellman, who had to retire from the New England Revolution because of post-concussion symptoms, agreed to donate his brain upon his death. As of 2010, the CSTE Brain Donation Registry consists of over 250 current and former athletes.[50] In 2011, former North Queensland Cowboys player Shaun Valentine became the first rugby player to agree to donate his brain upon his death, in response to recent concerns about the effects of concussions on Rugby League players, who do not use helmets. Also in 2011, boxer Micky Ward, whose career inspired the film The Fighter, agreed to donate his brain upon his death.
 In related research, the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes, which is part of the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is conducting research funded by National Football League Charities to ""study former football players, a population with a high prevalence of exposure to prior Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) and sub-concussive impacts, in order to investigate the association between increased football exposure and recurrent MTBI and neurodegenerative disorders such as cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD)"".[51]
 In February 2011, Dave Duerson committed suicide,[52] leaving text messages to loved ones asking that his brain be donated to research for CTE.[53] The family got in touch with representatives of the Boston University center studying the condition, said Robert Stern, the co-director of the research group. Stern said Duerson's gift was the first time of which he was aware that such a request had been made by someone who had committed suicide that was potentially linked to CTE.[54] Stern and his colleagues found high levels of the protein tau in Duerson's brain. These elevated levels, which were abnormally clumped and pooled along the brain sulci,[8] are indicative of CTE.[55]
 In July 2010, NHL enforcer Bob Probert died of heart failure. Before his death, he asked his wife to donate his brain to CTE research because it was noticed that Probert experienced a mental decline in his 40s. In March 2011, researchers at Boston University concluded that Probert had CTE upon analysis of the brain tissue he donated. He is the second NHL player from the program at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy to be diagnosed with CTE postmortem.[56]
 BUSM has also found indications of links between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and CTE in athletes who have participated in contact sports. Tissue for the study was donated by twelve athletes and their families to the CSTE Brain Bank at the Bedford, Massachusetts VA Medical Center.[57]
 In 2013, President Barack Obama announced the creation of the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium or CENC, a federally funded research project devised to address the long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury in military service personnel (SM's) and Veterans.[58][59][60] The CENC is a multi-center collaboration linking premiere basic science, translational, and clinical neuroscience researchers from the DoD, VA, academic universities, and private research institutes to effectively address the scientific, diagnostic, and therapeutic ramifications of mild TBI and its long-term effects.[61][62][63][64][65] Nearly 20% of the more than 2.5 million U.S. Service Members (SMs) deployed since 2003 to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) have sustained at least one traumatic brain injury (TBI), predominantly mild TBI (mTBI),[66][67] and almost 8% of all OEF/OIF Veterans demonstrate persistent post-TBI symptoms more than six months post-injury.[68][69] Unlike those head injuries incurred in most sporting events, recent military head injuries are most often the result of blast wave exposure.[citation needed] After a competitive application process, a consortium led by Virginia Commonwealth University was awarded funding.[61][62][63][64][70][71] The project principal investigator for the CENC is David Cifu, Chairman and Herman J. Flax professor[72] of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond, Virginia, with co-principal investigators Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, Professor of Neurology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences,[64] and Rick L. Williams, statistician at RTI International.

Concussions in Australian sport,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Concussions_in_Australian_sport,SI," 
 Head injuries in sports of any level (junior, amateur, professional) are the most dangerous and sickening kind of injuries that can occur in sport, and are becoming more common in Australian sport. Concussions are the most common side effect of a head injury and are defined as ""temporary unconsciousness or confusion and other symptoms caused by a blow to the head."" A concussion also falls under the category of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).[1] Especially in contact sports like Australian rules football and Rugby issues with concussions are prevalent, and methods to deal with, prevent and treat concussions are continuously being updated and researched to deal with the issue. Concussions pose a serious threat to the patients’ mental and physical health, as well as their playing career, and can result in lasting brain damage especially if left untreated. The signs that a player may have a concussion are: loss of consciousness or non-responsiveness, balance problems (unsteadiness on feet, poor co-ordination), a dazed, blank or vacant look and/or confusion and unawareness of their surroundings.[2] Of course the signs are relevant only after the player experiences a blow to the head.
 In the short term, concussions do not pose a serious problem and a player suffering may experience: headache, dizziness, loss of memory, blurred vision, confusion, disorientation and /or sensitiveness to bright light and loud noises.[3] However, the real danger occurs after repeated concussions suffered by the same player, if the player returns to play immediately after contracting a concussion or too soon after suffering one. If the player returns to play immediately or too soon after, there is an increased risk of another concussion (which is much more serious) as well as to the rest of the body due to a slower reaction time. The player can also suffer from a number of psychological issues like depression, as well as permanent brain damage and severe brain swelling.[2] A player, regardless of age or level of competition, should not return to play or training following a concussion, without a medical clearance from a registered medical doctor.
 In a high-impact game like Australian Rules Football, head injuries and concussions have always been common, but public awareness has risen over the last decade towards the dangers of continuing to play while suffering from a concussion. It is estimated that there are 5–6 players who suffer a concussion for every 1000 hours spent on the field, meaning there are 6–7 concussions per team during one season.[4] Previously, players at the elite level, either realised they would be pulled out of the game if they were identified as concussed hid the fact from coaches and continued to play, but recently the AFL released new concussion management guidelines to combat the issue. Now, only a medical officer with previous experience in the subject may declare the player fit to play, also the coaches are warned against rushing their players back into the team after suffering a concussion. The guidelines also dictate that immediately, or as soon as possible, after a player suffers a concussion, or is suspected of suffering from one, they must be subjected to a medical assessment after which they may or may not be allowed to return to the field depending on the results.[5] Introduced in 2013 in the AFL, the 'concussion sub' can be used when a player suffers a concussion or is suspected of having one, the player in question is substituted out of the game for at least 20 minutes, during which a test takes place to evaluate the players psychological well-being.
 The occurrence of concussions in amateur leagues are less common because of the lower impact intensity. However, concussions suffered at amateur levels can at times be more dangerous then those suffered in the AFL because of the inferior resources possessed and in some cases the coaches are not willing to pull a player out of the game, or rest them if they are suffering from a concussion.[6] A study conducted by the Australian Football Injury Prevention Project (AFIPP) in 2002 showed that out of 301 players (who play for amateur clubs in the Melbourne metropolitan area), 14 suffered from a form of head knock, 7 of which resulted in concussion.[7] 18.9% of players participating in the test suffered from concussion, bearing in mind that the sample size is also small.
 A separate study showed that out of 1015 Australian Rules Football players tested, 78 of them were concussed, 9 of which were concussed multiple times. The players mental functions were tested at controlled intervals with 38.6% of players still displaying symptoms at 48 hours after being concussed but after 96 hours, only 1.1% displayed any symptoms.[8]
 Cricket is classified differently to high intensity sports like Australian rules football and rugby, due to the stop-start nature of the game rather than continuous flowing play. However, due to the speed of fast bowlers and the hardness of cricket balls, cricket is still very much a high impact sport. Out of all Australian sporting codes, cricket requires the most protective gear to properly guard batsmen from a variety of injuries that can be afflicted all over the body. The most important piece of protective gear is the helmet, which includes a grill covering the face, to protect batsmen from head injuries. In the most recent Australian tour of the West Indies, now former Australian batsmen Chris Rogers suffered a concussion during training and was ruled out of the test series without playing a match. This has led Cricket Australia to plan out an updated concussion policy and guidelines[9] The principles are based on the International Consensus Conferences on Concussion in Sport (the Zurich Guidelines) and involve the player suspected of being concussed answering a set of questions to determine whether he has to leave the field. While concussion in cricket is considered quite rare due to increasingly safer helmets, the effects can be quite severe. NSW batsmen Ben Rohrer was struck in the head by a cricket ball during a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in November last year, he recalls his legs feeling like jelly and falling over on the pitch.[10] The most widely known case is the death of NSW batsmen Phillip Hughes who died after being receiving a cricket ball to the head in 2014.
 A study conducted with 542 junior cricket players revealed only 13% of injuries were limited to the facial region, and none of them suffered a concussion.[11]
 Most popular in New South Wales and Queensland, rugby can be classified into two different codes, rugby union and rugby league. Both are played at a very high level of intensity with full contact allowed, and as such has one of the highest concussion rates in the world, let alone Australia. Studies conducted into the incidence of concussion in professional and amateur levels of rugby have revealed that approximately 3.9 concussions per 1000 hours of play occur in professional rugby (1 concussion in every 6 games). Playing at the amateur level, concussion rates are much lower measured at 1 in every 21 matches (1.2 per 1000 hours). This amounts to roughly 5–7 concussions per team per season.[12]
 The National Rugby League released a 4 step set of guidelines, in 2012, for all coaches to follow in the case one of their players suffering a concussion during a game. The guidelines detail that the player be given basic first aid before being assessed by a medical officer, they also stress heavily that if the player is determined to be concussed there is no way the player should return to the field. if the concussion is serious, the player should be sent as soon as possible to hospital for medical treatment.[2]
 Wearing protective gear, such as a helmet and mouthguard, can reduce the chances of sustaining a concussion.
 The occurrence of concussion in children during sport is significantly more likely compared to other levels of athletes. Roughly 20% of children playing sport are diagnosed with concussion. Despite the lower level of impact compared to the professional or amateur levels, children's neck muscles are quite weak and most lack the awareness and skill level to cushion or prepare themselves for a blow leading to a high concussion rate.[13] The guidelines and protocols for a child suffering a concussion are basically the same as if an adult received one.
 For a child diagnosed with a concussion, the real issue is returning to school rather than the sporting field, as a concussion can affect a child's learning ability. A medical clearance is required before a return to school is possible and parents are recommended to properly manage their child through the first 72 hours after experiencing a concussion.[14]
 Concussions in sport
"
Concussions in high school sports,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Concussions_in_high_school_sports,SI," A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a blow, jolt or penetration to the head that disrupts the function of the brain. Most TBIs are caused by falls, jumps, motor vehicle traffic crashes, being struck by a person or a blunt object, and assault. Student-athletes may be put at risk in school sports, creating concern about concussions and brain injury.[1] A concussion[2] can be caused by
 The result of a concussion is neurological impairment that may resolve spontaneously but may also have long-term consequences.
 Many teens engage in extracurricular activities including sports that can pose risk of injury. Some sports that create a more significant risk of a head injury or concussion include basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football.[3][4] High school football accounts for a significant percentage of head injuries that result from high school sports.[1] While performing intense physical activity the brains' structure and functionality can be changed. This alteration in the brain may be a reason athletes in contact sports have concussions at higher. In combination with the contact and altered brain structure this can potentially lead to more severe concussions (Tremblay, Pascual-Leone, Théoret, 2018, p.172)..[5]
 Prevention efforts in high school athletics may include:
 Coaches, parents and students should educate themselves about concussions,[8] including knowing the signs of a concussion,[9] and being prepared to respond appropriately to incidents of head trauma and concussion.
 Schools should implement formal concussion plans that include elements of education, prevention, recognition, evaluation and management, so as to not only reduce the chance of concussion, but to ensure that concussions are promptly diagnosed[10] and that concussed student athletes receive proper medical care and are not endangered by a premature return to sports.[7][11][12] School concussion plans should also have a formal system for tracking compliance, and for identifying and responding to any deviations from the plan's standards.[11]
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists of possible signs of concussion that may appear in a student-athlete after a jolt to the head or body,[13][2] including:
 An injured student may report any of these signs as well as sensitivity to light or sound, double vision, a headache, or other abnormal feelings. A student who has been diagnosed with a concussion may become frustrated, impatient, and angry about the situation.[14]
 Concussions not only have physically noticeable effects, but they also leave behind effects not noticeable. Concussions can greatly impact the quality of sleep one receives. Concussions have been shown to cause sleep patterns to become inconsistent. Some nights you may sleep for an extended period of time whereas in others sleep time can be short. With acute concussions, sleep occurs for longer durations when compared to subacute. These irregular sleep patterns can have major health effects by making an individual susceptible to health concerns later on  (Raikes, Schaefer, 2016, p. 2145).[15] Concussions have also been shown to increase the risk for mental issues such as depression, CTE, dementia, and other cognitive issues (Guskiewicz et. al, 2005).[16] Concussion also have long term effects on the ability to learn and execute motor patterns. When compared to an individual with no concussions their motor learning speeds are lower and their ability to progress in activity were also lower. In other words, the time it takes to learn new physical activities has decreased as well as their ability to progress in difficulty has been lower. This is due to the brain being damaged and not being able to process information as quickly as a healthy brain (Beaulieu et. al, 2019, p. 105).[17] Concussions are one of the most common injuries amongst high school football players today. They can affect adolescents in the short term and the long term and can have some of the severe outcomes on a players career and life.
 In the game of football pads and helmets are good tools but do not completely protect the player. The helmets worn in football defend against most head injuries. These injuries include things like brain bleeds, skull fractures, and possible jaw injuries. What the helmets do not protect against are mTBI or mild traumatic brain injury. This is where concussions occur. Helmets cannot protect against them because they are simply a byproduct on of football. Due to the physicality of the sports, concussion or other head injuries are inevitable. For this to be changed the whole sport in its entirety will have to be changed (Bachynski, Goldberg, 2014, p 323-333).[18] But the choice to play football, in the end, is left to the families and the play themselves. If football is a sport they want to pursue, that is fine.
 A concussed player should receive proper medical treatment and should be excluded from practices and games until cleared to play by a qualified medical professional.[19]
"
Concussions in rugby union,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Concussions_in_rugby_union,SI," 
 Concussions in England's professional rugby union are the most common injury received.[1] Concussion can occur where an individual experiences an impact to the head. Commonly occurring in high contact sporting activities; American football, boxing, and rugby. It can also occur in recreational activities like horse riding, jumping, cycling, and skiing. The reason being that it doesn't have to be something to strike you in the proximity of your brain, but can also be caused by rapid change of movement, giving the skull not enough time to move with your body, causing your brain to press against your skull.[2] With rugby being such a contact and fast moving sport, it is no wonder why there is concussion and other head injuries occurring. With the development of equipment and training methods, these will help benefit the players on the field know what could happen and how they can help with preventing it.
 A concussion, which is known as a subset of traumatic brain injury (TBI), is when a force comes in contact with the head, neck or face, or fast movement of the head, causing a functional injury to the brain.[3] Depending on where the location of impact, depends on the severity of the injury. It is short-lived impairment of neurological function, the brains ability to process information, which can be resolved in seven to ten days.[1] Not all concussion involves the loss of consciousness, with it occurring in less than 10% of concussions.[3] Second-impact syndrome is when a player has obtained a second concussion when you either return to field the same day, or return to play before a complete recovery from a previous concussion. This is a result from brain swelling, from vascular congestion and increased intracranial pressure, this can be fatal to a player as it is a very difficult medical injury to control.[4] The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which protects it from light trauma. More severe impacts, or the forces associated with rapid acceleration, may not be absorbed by this cushion. Concussion may be caused by impact forces, in which the head strikes or is struck by something, or impulsive forces, in which the head moves without itself being subject to blunt trauma (for example, when the chest hits something and the head snaps forward). Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or ""CTE"", is an example of the cumulative damage that can occur as the result of multiple concussions or less severe blows to the head. The condition was previously referred to as ""dementia pugilistica"", or ""punch drunk"" syndrome, as it was first noted in boxers. The disease can lead to cognitive and physical handicaps such as parkinsonism, speech and memory problems, slowed mental processing, tremor, depression, and inappropriate behavior. It shares features with Alzheimer's disease.
 In a 2013 interview, recently retired Scotland international Rory Lamont was critical of the then-current protocols for handling concussions, notably the Pitchside Suspected Concussion Assessment (PSCA) employed at that time::
 Rugby union has been played since the early eighteen hundreds. Being a high contact sport it has the highest announced rates of concussion.[6] Research finding that during match play, concussion was reported at a higher level, and during training at a lower level, but still at a higher level than most players of another sport to receive.[6] With the game being both physically and mentally demanding, it varies from being at high intensities of sprinting, tackling and rucking, with small intensities of jogging and walking. The position of the forwards consists of them having to have a lot of physical strength to get the ball from the other team, or create gaps for their team to run through. Where as the backs are the players that make the play happen, making runs with the ball, with the protection of the forwards stopping attacks, the backs still do get tackled like any other player on the field, so they have to have physical strength as much as a forward. The Concussion bin was replaced by the head bin in 2012 with the players assessment taking 10 minutes.[7]
 Concussion was the most commonly reported Premiership Rugby match injury in 2015-16 (for the 5th consecutive season), constituting appropriately 25% of all match injuries, and the RFU medical officer said that the tackle is where the overwhelming majority of concussions occur.[8]
A study found that playing more than 25 matches in the 2015/2016 season meant that sustaining concussion was more likely than not sustaining concussion.[9]
 Some of the effects that concussion can cause to an individuals mind set can vary, depending on the circumstances and the severity of the impact. The common signs of concussion can be; blank look, slow to get up off of the ground, unsteady on their feet, grabbing their head, confused in where they are or what they are doing, and obviously if they are unconscious.[10] These are the things that a spectator, coach and medical assistant will notice in a player. Sometimes concussion can go unrecognised, so from a players point there can be these symptoms; continual headaches, dizziness, visual problems, feeling of fatigue and drowsiness.[10] These all can occur post game, so a player needs to have knowledge of what these signs could mean.
 Once taken off the field of play due to possible concussion, being unconscious, or showing the symptoms post game, getting medical advice as soon as possible is recommended. At the hospital or medical practice, the player will be under observation, if they are experiencing a headache, mild pain killers will be given. The medical professional will request that no food or drink is to be consumed until advised.[11] They will then assess whether the player needs an x-ray, to check for any possible cervical vertebrae damage, or a computerised axial tomography (CT Scan) to check for any brain or cranium damage.[11] With a mild head injury being sent home to take care and doing activities slower than usual, and maintaining painkillers. If symptoms of concussion don't disappear in the average of seven to ten days, then seek medical advice again as injury could be worse. In post-concussion syndrome, symptoms do not resolve for weeks, months, or years after a concussion, and may occasionally be permanent. About 10% to 20% of people have post concussion syndrome for more than a month.
 In order to minimise the risk of concussion and repetitive head trauma, the method of the 6 R's is used.[10] Firstly Recognising and Removing a suspected player of concussion, to stop the injury from getting worse. Secondly Refer, whether the player is either recognised or suspected with concussion they must see a medical doctor as soon as possible. 90.8% of players knew they should not continue playing when concussed. 75% of players would continue an important game even if concussed. Of those concussed, 39.1% have tried to influence medical assessment with 78.2% stating it is possible or quite easy to do so. If the player is diagnosed with concussion, they then must Rest, until all signs of concussion are gone. The player must then Recover by just returning to general activities in life, then progressing back to playing. Returning to play, must follow the Graduated Return to Play (GRTP) protocol, by having clearance from a medical professional, and no symptoms of concussion.[10] Despite good knowledge of concussion complications, management players engage in unsafe behaviour with little difference between gender and competition grades. Information regarding symptoms and management should be available to all players, coaches, and parents. On-going education is needed to assist coaches in identifying concussion signs and symptoms.  Provision of medical care should be mandatory at every level of competition.
 A 2017 study found that past participation in rugby or a history of concussion were associated with small to moderate neurocognitive deficits after retirement from competitive sport.[12]
"
Injured list,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Injured_list,SI," 
 In Major League Baseball (MLB), the injured list [IL] (known as the disabled list [DL] prior to the 2019 season) is a method for teams to remove their injured players from the roster in order to summon healthy players.
 Players are placed on either the 10-day (prior to the 2017 season, 15-day)[1] or the 60-day injured list, usually depending on the severity and/or recovery time of the injury.
 Placing a player on the injured list opens a spot on the active roster. Another player from the minor leagues, free agent pool, a traded player, or a recovered player coming off the injured list may be used to fill this spot. This allows a team to avoid the disadvantage of playing with an incapacitated player on the bench.
 The player may not rejoin the active roster until the minimum 10 or 60 days has elapsed; however, a player's time on the injured list may exceed the specified number of days, and, further, if a player is transferred to the 60-day injured list after August 1, he may not return to the active roster that season.
 The 10-day injured list does not count the player on the active roster (comprising the 25-man roster until September 1), whereas the 60-day injured list does not require the player to be counted on either the team's active roster or its 40-man roster; however, a team's 40-man roster must be full in order for the option of a placement on the 60-day injured list to be available.[2] A player may be shifted from the 10-day to the 60-day injured list at any time, but not vice versa.
 The rule about rejoining the active roster only applies to eligibility to play in a game. Players are permitted to stay with the team and attend games, though players may leave the team to focus on treatment, to avoid traveling with the team on a road trip, and/or for short term minor league rehabilitation assignments to prepare for their return to the active roster.
 Alternatively, a team may elect to keep a slightly injured player on the roster but list him as 'day-to-day' to indicate that the medical staff is unable to determine when the player can resume full playing activities. If the injury turns out to be minor, then the player may resume playing immediately without having to serve the minimum term on the injured list; however, depending upon the circumstances, the team may find itself effectively shorthanded in the meantime. This also allows a valuable, slightly injured player to continue to contribute in a limited role, such as pinch hitting. Retroactive placement on the IL may be made at most 10 days after the last time the affected player played in a game.[3] This allows a club to defer the decision to place a player on the injured list until more information can be learned about the extent and impact of the injury.
 Starting with the 2011 season, Major League Baseball instituted a new, shorter injured list: a 7-day list specifically for concussions. The idea is to prevent long-term brain damage which may take up to 7 days by current standards[4], without having to serve the 10-day minimum on the regular IL. If a player is not activated from the concussion injured list after 10 days have passed, he is automatically transferred to the 10-day injured list.
 Also in 2011, Major League Baseball instituted a paternity list. This allows a team to replace a player who is an expectant father for 1–3 days on the roster to be available for the birth of his child.[5]
 A player may be placed on the bereavement list upon attending to a seriously ill member in the player's immediate family or to a death in the family. The bereavement list may span from a minimum of three to a maximum of seven games.[6] Umpiring's bereavement list for death in the immediate family may span up to a full season.[7]
 Minor League Baseball uses a seven-day injured list for all injuries. Players who are on the 40-man roster but get hurt in the minor leagues are placed on the minor league IL, but not on the major league IL. One problem this poses is that a player who is injured in the minors and who would be placed on the major league 60-day IL cannot be placed on the 60-day, meaning the 40-man roster spot is not freed up.
 A free roster spot on an MLB club can be strategically valuable, leading to occasional creative use of injured lists by MLB teams and their minor league affiliates (similar to teams strategically appealing or dropping an appeal of a disciplinary suspension, in order align the timing of the sentence to optimize player contribution). Poor performing, slightly injured players might be put on the IL to be assigned to the minors for rehab, when the MLB club might really want them reassigned primarily because of performance, but might not otherwise be able to reassign them due to service time, lack of options, contract stipulations, etc. The Collective Bargaining Agreement between the players and the league contains rules against blatantly ""gaming the system.""
 Players recovering from an injury may appear in a limited number of minor league games while still on the injured list in order to prepare for reactivation. Pitchers may play on a minor league club for up to 30 days; others for up to 20 days.[8]
 The term ""disabled list"" was used as far back as 1887, and was common terminology in MLB for over 100 years until being changed to the current ""injured list"" prior to the 2019 season.[9] The name was changed after MLB was requested to do so by disability advocates, and also allows the term to be consistent with other professional sports that use an ""injured reserve list"".[10] Players on the ""injured list"" are not necessarily injured, some being ill or disabled from playing for other reasons.[11]
 The categories and variety of disabled lists have changed numerous times over the years. The 15-day disabled list was introduced in 1966, joining 10-day, 21-day and 30-day options, and the 60-day disabled list in 1990. Prior to 1990, the number of players who could be placed on each list was limited, players with major league contracts were not allowed to go to the minor leagues for rehabilitation, and there was less flexibility about when they could return to action. The 10-day disabled list was dropped in 1984 but restored for the 2017 season (replacing the 15-day option), and the 21-day and 30-day options were dropped in 1990 with the introduction of the 60-day disabled list.[12]
"
Footballer's ankle,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Footballer%27s_ankle,SI," Footballer's Ankle is a pinching or impingement of the ligaments or tendons of the ankle between the bones, particularly the talus and tibia. This results in pain, inflammation and swelling.
 A common cause of anterior impingement is a bone spur on anklebone (talus) or the shinbone (tibia). Repeated kicking actions can cause the anklebone to hit the bottom of the shinbone, which can lead to a lump of bone (or bone spur) developing. This bone spur may then begin to impact on the soft tissue at the front of the ankle, causing inflammation and swelling. The condition is most common in athletes who repeatedly bend the ankle upward (dorsiflexion), such as footballers, hence the name.
 - pain and tenderness over anterior ankle joint
- pain on dorsiflexion and plantar flexion
- band of pain across anterior ankle when kicking a ball
- palpable bony lump on distal tibia or superior talus
 - soft tissue techniques to stretch muscles crossing the ankle to relieve tension
- mobilisation of ankle joint
- steroid injection to reduce inflammation
- surgery to remove bony spurs
"
Golfer's elbow,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Golfer%27s_elbow,SI," Golfer's elbow, or medial epicondylitis, is tendinosis of the medial epicondyle on the inside of the elbow. It is in some ways similar to tennis elbow, which affects the outside at the  lateral epicondyle.
 The anterior forearm contains several muscles that are involved with flexing the digits of the hand, and flexing and pronating the wrist. The tendons of these muscles come together in a common tendinous sheath, which originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus at the elbow joint. In response to minor injury, or sometimes for no obvious reason at all, this point of insertion becomes inflamed.
 The condition is called golfer's elbow because in making a golf swing this tendon is stressed, especially if a non-overlapping (baseball style) grip is used; many people, however, who develop the condition have never handled a golf club. It is also sometimes called pitcher's elbow[1] due to the same tendon being stressed by the throwing of objects such as a baseball, but this usage is much less frequent. Other names are climber's elbow and little league elbow: all of the flexors of the fingers and the pronators of the forearm insert at the medial epicondyle of the humerus to include: pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor digitorum superficialis, and palmaris longus;[2] making this the most common elbow injury for rock climbers, whose sport is grip intensive. The pain is normally caused due to stress on the tendon as a result of the large amount of grip exerted by the digits and torsion of the wrist which is caused by the use and action of the cluster of muscles on the condyle of the ulna.[3] However, more than 90% of cases are not actually from sports-related injuries, but rather from labor-related occupations with forceful repetitive activities (such as construction and plumbing).[4]
 Epicondylitis is much more common on the lateral side of the elbow (tennis elbow), rather than the medial side. In most cases, its onset is gradual and symptoms often persist for weeks before a person seeks care. In golfer's elbow, pain at the medial epicondyle is aggravated by resisted wrist flexion and pronation, which is used to aid diagnosis. Tennis elbow is indicated by the presence of lateral epicondylar pain precipitated by resisted wrist extension.[5][6]
 To diagnose golfer's elbow, clinicians may apply force to the elbow and wrist. If the subject indicates pain or inability to resist on the medial side, golfer's elbow may be present. Visual signs and symptoms are used to assist medical diagnosis.[7]
 Radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to assess the structural integrity of the different tissues of the elbow and may assist in making a more accurate diagnosis.[4]
 Non-specific treatments include:
 Before anesthetics and steroids are used, conservative treatment with an occupational therapist may be attempted. Before therapy can commence, treatment such as rest, ice, compression and elevation (R.I.C.E.) will typically be used. This will help to decrease the pain and inflammation; rest will alleviate discomfort because golfer's elbow is an overuse injury. The subject can use a tennis elbow splint for compression. A pad can be placed anteromedially on the proximal forearm.[8] The splint is made in 30–45 degrees of elbow flexion. A daytime elbow pad also may be useful, by limiting additional trauma to the nerve.
 Therapy includes a variety of exercises for muscle and tendon reconditioning, starting with stretching and gradual strengthening of the flexor-pronator muscles.[7] Strengthening will slowly begin with isometrics and progresses to eccentric exercises helping to extend the range of motion back to where it once was. After the strengthening exercises, it is common for the subject to ice the area.[8]
 Simple analgesic medication has a place, as does more specific treatment with oral anti-inflammatory medications. These will help control pain and any inflammation.[8] A more invasive treatment is the injection into and around the inflamed and tender area of a glucocorticoid (steroid) agent.[9] After causing an initial exacerbation of symptoms lasting 24 to 48 hours, this may produce an improvement of the condition in some five to seven days.[citation needed]
 After 6 months if the symptoms do not improve, surgery may be recommended. Surgical debridement or cleaning of the area is one of the most common treatments.[7] The ulnar nerve may also be decompressed surgically.[8] If the appropriate remediation steps are taken - rest, ice, and rehabilitative exercise and stretching - recovery may follow. Few subjects will need to progress to steroid injection, and less than 10% will require surgical intervention.[8] Arthroscopy is not an option for treating golfer's elbow.[7]
"
Health issues in American football,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Health_issues_in_American_football,SI," 
 Health issues in American football comprise a large number of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.
 Catastrophic injuries—defined as serious injury to the spine, spinal cord, or brain—and fatalities are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although a small number of them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.
 In many cases, injuries sustained while playing can cause long-term damage. In addition to neurological damage caused by hits to the head, injuries to the mid and lower body can force players to retire or lead to nagging ailments in later life.  Various methods have been used to reduce injuries in football, including rule changes such as the abolition of large wedge formations; a sharp decline in cervical spine injuries since the 1970s has been attributed to rule changes that altered blocking and tackling techniques. More recently, rule changes to protect players from head injuries have been instituted. Equipment like the football helmet and pads are used to give players a level of protection from injuries, while other factors such as cleat size are used to minimize the risk of injuries due to field condition.
 Because American football is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, and there are an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. 50% of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.[1]
 The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions.[1] According to the NFL Physicians Society, the most common injuries in football are ""concussions, blunt injuries to the chest such as cardiac contusions, pulmonary contusions, broken ribs, abdominal injuries, splenic lacerations and kidney injuries.""[2] Orthopedic injuries to the knee, foot, ankle, shoulder, neck and back are also common, as are muscle strains to the hamstrings, quads, calves and the abdomen.[2]
 Concussions are particularly concerning,[3] as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk in later life for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression.[4] Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees,[5] and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures.[6] Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.[1]
 Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) are an issue in both high-school and professional-level football.[7] Steroid use has been linked to an increased risk for musculoskeletal injuries among players.[8] Human growth hormone (HGH) is used by some players to improve performance, recover from injuries, decrease aging, and to lose weight. Although none of these uses are scientifically proven or legal, HGH places users at risk for adverse side effects such as onset of diabetes and negatively impacting joints and organs such as the heart. However, there have been no studies of HGH use or the baseline levels of the hormone in NFL athletes.[9] NFL players are routinely subject to drug tests in accordance with the NFL's two substance policies. Players found using performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids, can face suspension and other penalties.[10] As of 2014, the league does not test for HGH use among players.[11]
 An injury report section is common in the sports sections of American newspapers, detailing injuries for each team and the amount of time each injured player is expected to be out. The injury report was created to prevent gamblers from gaining inside information about injuries from players, and as a result, NFL teams must report on the status of injured players on a set schedule during the season. The standard severity descriptions are ""out"" (will not play in the upcoming game); ""doubtful"" (25% chance of playing); ""questionable"" (50% chance of playing); or ""probable"" (75% chance of playing). Teams have been known to downplay, exaggerate or overly detail their teams' injuries in an attempt to confuse or mislead upcoming opponents.[12] Injured players may be placed on one of several injured lists, including the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list. If a player is injured in an event outside of a game or team practice, or during collegiate practice prior to being drafted, he is eligible for the Nonfootball Injury list. Players who have sustained major injuries and are not expected to play for the rest of the season may be placed on the Injured Reserve (IR) list. These players do not count towards the teams' roster limit.[13]
 According to the College Football Assistance Fund, over 20,000 injuries occur from college football each year.[14] The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) maintains an injury list similar to that used by the NFL – injured players are listed as ""Out"", ""Doubtful"", ""Questionable"", or ""Probable"", but suspended players are also included on the list.[15] College players are limited to four years of eligibility, but can receive a medical redshirt that lets them play another year if they have suffered a season-ending injury and have not played in more than 30% of the season's games.[16]
 In 1994, the NFL established the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later replaced by the Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating that there is not enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury.[18][19] Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because he did not have a background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists.[18][20] In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone.[21][22] The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries.[23] A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.[24]
 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues.[25] Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together.[23] In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.[26]
 Concussions are also an issue outside of professional football. In a 2010 study by Purdue University and Indiana University, an estimated 43,000 to 67,000 football players suffer a concussion every season. However, because many injuries go unreported, the true number may exceed 100,000. The study, ""Functionally-Detected Cognitive Impairment in High School Football Players Without Clinically Diagnosed Concussion"", was published in 2013 in the Journal of Neurotrauma and observed 21 high school players throughout a season;  it determined that even players who would not be diagnosed with a concussion based on their symptoms can display notable impairments via MRIs and verbal or cognitive testing, indicating that the current tests used on the sideline to assess concussions may not be adequate.[28][29] A 2013 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that concussion rates in college football exceed those in any other sport, and that high school players have twice the risk of sustaining a concussion as collegiate players. The study found that, as reported by athletic trainers, college football players sustain 6.3 concussions for every 10,000 athletic exposures (meaning an individual practice or game), and the rate for high school football players is 11.2. The high school concussion figure is nearly double that of the next-highest sport, lacrosse. The study, funded by a $75,000 donation from the NFL to the Centers for Disease Control Foundation, also found that there is no evidence that newer helmet technology decreases the risk for concussions.[17]
 Catastrophic injuries are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent neurological damage across all high school sports in the United States from 1982 to 2011.[31] In football, catastrophic injuries are rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since the introduction of the modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher at the high school level than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. 56% of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.[32]
 The medical costs for catastrophic injuries can be extremely high—a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center notes that first-year costs of someone who has high tetraplegia, an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is USD $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that boosters help families pay for these policies.[31]
 Catastrophic injuries have been on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking.[33] However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground.[5] Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.[33]
 Fatalities in football are rare. A 2013 study of high school and college football players split fatalities into two types: direct fatalities, defined as those caused by ""trauma from participation in a sport resulting in a brain injury, cervical fracture, or intra-abdominal injury"" and indirect fatalities, defined as those resulting from external factors such as ""cardiac failure, heat illness, sickle cell trait [SCT], asthma, or pulmonary embolism"". The study found that, on average, there are 4 direct fatalities and 8.2 indirect fatalities among high school and college players per year, making indirect fatalities more than twice as common as direct fatalities.[34]
 In addition to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study by researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988.[35] The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male.[35] The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This may be due to the increased momentum of collisions from speed players.[35]
 Outside of neurodegenerative disorders, physical injuries sustained during a career can have an adverse effect on post-career life. A 1990 survey conducted jointly between the NFLPA and Ball State University found that 65% of surveyed players had suffered a major injury (defined as one that caused them to miss at least eight games): among players that played before 1959 this number was 42%, but it jumps to 72% among those who played in the 1980s. Additionally, roughly 50% of players who had played in the 1970s and 1980s reported that they retired due to injury, compared to only 32% among those who played prior to 1959. Two-thirds of players reported that injuries they had sustained limited their ability to engage in recreational activity and sports in retirement, while half said their injuries decreased their ability to perform manual labor. A follow-up survey in 1994 found that 47% of recipients reported having arthritis. These reports have been attributed to several factors, including the increase in the use of artificial turf as well as the increasing size and speed of players. Dr. James Andrews, a noted orthopedic surgeon, said that ""athletes are bigger, stronger and running faster, and they're tearing up knees from cutting, changing direction on a dime"". Andrews also noted the increase in the number of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, which he attributed to the size of modern players.[36]
 Injuries have always been a part of football, and various methods have been used historically and in modern times to prevent them. One method that has been used to prevent injuries is changing the rules of the sport. An early example of this was the elimination of mass formations like the flying wedge in the early 1900s, due to the large number of severe injuries the formations caused.[37] Smaller wedges consisting of three, four, or five players were frequently used on kickoff returns before wedges were limited to two or fewer players in 2009 by the NFL;[38] a similar rule was adopted by the NCAA a year later.[39] The sharp decrease in the number of catastrophic cervical spine injuries since the mid-1970s has been partially credited to rule changes that modified tackling and blocking techniques.[1] With the increasing awareness of the long-term effects of concussions, the NFL has passed rules prohibiting the targeting of ""defenseless"" players over-the-shoulder, requiring plays to be blown dead when the runner loses his helmet, and placing more stringent limits to the ability of players who have sustained a concussion to return to play.[40]
 Similarly, modern equipment was developed to reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures.[6] The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s to protect themselves from head injuries.[41] Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries.[42] Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues;[43] at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory.[44] Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – players prefer a shorter cleat when playing on artifical turf to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction.[43] Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area.[45] Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.[1]
"
Helmet removal (sports),https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Helmet_removal_(sports),SI," In organized athletics, few situations give rise to greater anxiety than the 'downed athlete'.
Obvious causes include head and neck injury, or both, with no immediate means of excluding neck injury in the athlete who may be unable to give a history.  
Compounding the problem is the potential for the athlete's airway being compromised.  
Such a situation requires effective triage with the possibility of the athlete's injury being worsened or its effects being made permanent, if the initial steps taken are not appropriate.  
Paradoxically, the equipment designed to prevent or mitigate injury, such as helmets, face masks, neck rolls and shoulder pads, contributes to the complexity of the steps needed to be taken.  
Finally, environmental challenges, such as the difficulty of first responders moving on an ice arena, or maneuvering an ambulance through inadequate access routes, will add to the problem if not previously addressed by inspection of facilities and, in the best circumstances, rehearsal.
 
There is a hierarchy of serious consequences of athletic injury, at the top of which is head and neck injury.  Consequently, when a potential head or neck (or combined injury) is observed, the level of anxiety in training and medical staff rises.  This concern relates to the possibility of the bony and protective structures of the neck, the cervical spine and its ligaments, having been fractured and torn, but the nerve cord escaping initial injury, only to be injured inadvertently by responders' efforts to assist the player. The consequence of injury to the nerve cord is, in the worst of circumstances, quadriplegia.
This is an inappropriate time for practice conflicts to arise and the potential is real, although the less so the more organized the situation. For example, Emergency Medicine Technicians (EMTs) and Paramedics are trained to remove helmets while athletic training staff and the NCAA believe that the helmet should be left in place, unless the athlete's airway is compromised and cannot be managed otherwise.
 
This potential conflict relates to the design of the helmet used in the situation to which each of the parties most frequently responds. With EMTs and paramedics, it is most often motor vehicle accidents. With athletic training staff, it is exclusively athletic events unless acting in the role of 'Good Samaritan'. Helmets worn by motorcyclists and four-wheel operators are usually of an integral design making removal of the face mask either impossible or extremely difficult. Consequently, management of a compromised airway demands removal of the helmet. On the other hand, helmets worn in football and ice hockey, are designed specifically so that the face mask may be quickly removed, although the technique for its removal will vary by helmet design. Accordingly, potential and serious difference in practice should be avoided by good communication between athletic training staff and first responders prior to the start of the event.
Certified athletic training staff are familiar with the helmet model currently in use by their athletes, are expert in its removal, and carry the equipment needed to do so, and there is no substitute for familiarity and practice.  At the same time, investigation and development of improved, face mask release systems is ongoing.[1]
 
The National Collegiate Athletic Association in its advice to athletic trainers and team physicians, contained in the NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook, advises that the helmet should never be removed from an injured athlete, conscious or unconscious, with a suspected or potential head or neck injury during pre-hospital management. In this advice, certain assumptions are made. The first is that the facemask can be removed so that airway care, if needed, can be carried out. The second is that the helmet fits securely so that supporting the helmet will support the athlete's head and neck. The advice accepts that helmet removal may be necessary if an ill-fitting helmet prevents the head and neck from being secured safely for emergency transport. It is also accepted that helmet removal may be necessary if, for some reason or another, the facemask cannot be removed in a reasonable time. There is general agreement that should helmet removal be required, it should only be carried out by trained personnel. The NCAA also asserts that the injured athlete should be maneuvered to a spine board for transport as a 'single unit' using a lift/slide maneuver or log-roll technique.
[2]
 
With agreement on the importance in maintaining cervical spine alignment, and by implication, the most common strategy of leaving the helmet and shoulder pads in place, the immediate task falls into two parts: Currently, face masks fall into two broad categories, the 'traditional', secured by screws and plastic loops or thin wire ties and a combination of screws and T-nuts, and the 'innovative' using some additional type of proprietary 'quick release' hardware. However, it should be recognized that helmet and face mask design is an area of active development and change.
 
Whichever, removal customarily involves cutting/releasing the loop straps and various tools have been advocated including cutting tools and cordless screwdrivers.[3][4]  In some studies, the cordless screwdriver has been shown to be the most efficient and quickest.[1]   However, concern has been raised concerning the use of a single technique when helmet fittings have been degraded by poor maintenance.  In those circumstances, a screw seized with rust, or in which the threads have been stripped, may be encountered.  Accordingly, there has been advocacy for a reliable, combined, tool technique such as a cordless screwdriver with backup cutting tool.[5] Moreover, in some innovative designs, a cutting tool is essential.
 In general, 'quick release' face-mask attachments appear to make face-mask removal quicker and cause less unwanted movement of the athlete's head or neck. The opposite is the case in cutting loop straps.[1]
 At some stage, the helmet and protective equipment will need to be removed. How this may be done with minimum risk remains a question of importance.
 First, there are three possible athlete/equipment configurations:
 Of the three options, the least desirable appears to be helmet removal with shoulder pads retained (third choice), that combination potentially allowing the head to drop back in relation to the shoulders inducing the greatest amount of movement (extension) of the cervical spine.[6]
 It was also previously held that X-ray of the neck should be carried out before movement of the neck was permitted. Since retention of helmet and shoulder pads would be the least disruptive to the neck as previously observed, the second question to arise became the reliability of what is referred to as cross-table lateral X-ray of the neck, the routine radiologic procedure in such cases. Although previously regarded as standard procedure, at least one study has found that football equipment is an impediment to accurate X-ray interpretation.[7] In those with significant trauma X-ray computed tomography is a more accurate test.[8]
 Current opinion now suggests that X-ray of the cervical spine adds little to what can be obtained by clinical examination and two clinical assessment strategies have been validated, the first being the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) and the second, the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR). The first has a reported sensitivity for detecting cervical spine injury of 99% and the second, if anything, higher.[9] 
 Accordingly, a practice has arisen that ""clears"" the patient from cervical spinal injury if the following criteria are met:
 Since the last part of the exam requires removal of cervical restraints such as collars and attachments to spinal boards etc., the implication is that it is 'safe' to remove such restraints if the first four criteria are satisfied.
 In the event that application of the above criteria fails to indicate a 'normal cervical spine', the next step currently is CT examination, which has a reported 98-99% sensitivity for cervical spinal injury.[11]
A separate imaging technique, magnetic resonance imaging, has been found to be too prone to artifacts from parts of the protective equipment to be clinically useful.[12]
 It should be understood that, apart from the clinical examination rules and CT, the majority of sports or athletic information has been derived from studies involving football, ice hockey and motorcycle accidents. This induces an age (late adolescence and young adult) and gender (mainly male) bias. Consequently, caution should be used in applying the conclusions to injuries involving the use of helmets of other design such as those used in lacrosse, horseback riding, baseball/softball, or cycling. They also cannot necessarily be applied to a younger or female population without caution.

Helmet-to-helmet collision,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Helmet-to-helmet_collision,SI," Helmet-to-helmet collisions are occurrences in American and Canadian football when two players' helmets make head-to-head contact with a high degree of force. Intentionally causing a helmet-to-helmet collision is a penalty in most football leagues, including many high school leagues. [1]
 Despite its long association with American football, this type of contact is now considered to be dangerous play by league authorities due to the potential of causing serious injury. Major football leagues, such as the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL), and NCAA, have taken a tougher stance on helmet-to-helmet collisions after the US Congress launched an investigation into the effects repeated concussions have on football players and the new discoveries of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).[2] Other possible injuries include head traumas, spinal cord injuries, and even death. Helmet manufacturers are constantly improving their designs in order to best protect their users against injuries from such collisions.[3]
 The crackdown on helmet-to-helmet collisions has resulted in reappraisals of the sport. An image of two helmets smashing together—which had been a staple for 20 years—was dropped in 2006 from Monday Night Football on ESPN. The NFL also ordered Toyota Motor Company to stop using a similar helmet collision in its advertisements.[4]
 Despite the safety concerns, in 2010, some professional football players criticized bans on helmet-to-helmet collisions on the basis that gridiron football is a game that is supposed to be composed of the world's biggest and best athletes, and placing such restrictions ""waters down"" the game.[11]
"
Injured reserve list,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Injured_reserve_list,SI," The injured reserve list (abbr. IR list) is a designation used in professional sports leagues for athletes who become injured and temporarily unable to play. The exact name of the list varies by league; it is known as ""injured reserve"" in the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL), the ""injured list"" in the Canadian Football League (CFL), and the injured list (historically known as the ""disabled list"") in Major League Baseball (MLB). The National Basketball Association (NBA) does not have a direct analog to an injured reserve list, instead using a more general-purpose ""inactive list"" that does not require a player to be injured.
 It is used because the rules of these leagues allow for only a certain numbers of players on each team's roster. Designating a player as ""Injured/Reserve"" frees up a roster spot, enabling the team to add a new replacement player during the injured athlete's convalescence.
 A player may be placed on injured reserve if he is unable to participate due to illness or injury, provided that the player had passed the club's initial physical examination at the start of the season. To qualify for the IR due to injury, that injury must be sufficient (in the opinion of the team's medical staff) to render the player unable to participate for the seven days following that injury. Once placed on IR, the team may then replace the player on their roster. The player on IR may not return to active play for seven days, although they may participate in non-competitive events such as practice, meetings, etc.[1]
 A team may place a player on injured reserve (reserve/injured list) who is ""not immediately available for participation with a club"". Generally, these players may not practice or return to the Active List for the rest of the season (including postseason games or the Pro Bowl) in which they are placed on injured reserve, but are allowed to be with the team.[2]
 During the preseason, the league also allows players with long-term, but not season-ending, injuries to be placed into one of two designations: physically unable to perform (PUP), for injuries sustained during the previous season or during offseason training activities (a player who passes their physical at the beginning of training camp and practices is physically able to participate and is thus ineligible for the PUP list), or reserve/non-football injury, for injuries sustained outside of team or league activities (despite the name, this includes lingering injuries from college football play, should an injured player be drafted and join the team). Both designations are functionally identical in that the player can be promoted to the active roster by week 6 of the regular season or placed on injured reserve. During the regular season, players on the PUP list and injured reserve do not count against the league's 53 man roster maximum, but do count against the 90 man roster limit (also includes practice squad players). 
 Starting in 2012, the NFL and the NFLPA reached an agreement allowing one player placed on injured reserve to be brought back to the active roster.[3] Provided that the player was on the final 53-man preseason roster (A rule exempted for the 2012 season), and that the injury is deemed to keep this  player unable to practice or play football for an estimated six weeks, the player may be allowed to practice after Week 6, and be activated to play after Week 8.[4] As of 2017, teams may now return two players from injured reserve after Week 8.[5]
 Teams may also place a player on injured reserve with a minor injury designation, but the team must release the player once he is healthy.[6]
 Due to abuses in the use of the injured reserve list, where some teams found it convenient to use the IR to stash players without independent medical oversight, the injured reserve has been renamed the Inactive List with the last collective bargaining agreement. Starting in the 2005–06 season, players can enter the inactive list one hour before tip-off for as little as one game. The inactive list has a minimum of one player and a maximum of three, subject to hardship rules when a team with three injured players already on its inactive list has a fourth player injured. Players sent to the NBA G League will continue to count on a team's inactive list.[7][8]
 Unlike its parent league, the WNBA has no injury list as of the 2019 season. This notably affected the Seattle Storm going into that season, when reigning league MVP Breanna Stewart tore her right Achilles in the 2019 EuroLeague Women final. Because of the lack of an injured list, the Storm suspended Stewart without pay to free up a roster spot. (The WNBA would later make Stewart a paid league ambassador during her rehabilitation.)[9]
 The league had an injury list when it began play in 1997; players placed on this list were required to sit out at least three games. In 2006, the league changed to an inactive list of up to two players, but it was eliminated after the 2008 season, when rosters were reduced to 11. WNBA rosters now consist of 12 players.[9]
 There are four types of injured reserve lists in Major League Baseball.

Knee dislocation,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Knee_dislocation,SI," 
 A knee dislocation is a knee injury in which there is a complete disruption of the joint between the tibia and the femur.[3][4] Symptoms include knee pain and instability of the knee.[2] Complications may include injury to an artery around the knee, most commonly the artery behind the knee, or compartment syndrome.[3][4][7]
 About half of cases are the result of major trauma and about half occur as a result of minor trauma.[3] In about half of cases the joint reduces itself before a person arrives at the hospital.[3] Typically there is a break of the anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and either the medial collateral ligament or lateral collateral ligament.[3] If the ankle–brachial pressure index is less than 0.9, CT angiography is recommended to detect blood vessel injury.[3] Otherwise repeated physical exams may be sufficient.[2]
 If the joint remains dislocated, reduction and splinting is indicated;[4] this is typically carried out under procedural sedation.[2] In those with signs of arterial injury, immediate surgery is generally carried out.[3] Multiple surgeries may be required.[4] In just over 10% of cases, an amputation of part of the leg is required.[4]
 Knee dislocations are rare, occurring in about 1 per 100,000 people per year.[3] Males are more often affected than females.[2] Younger adults are most often affected.[2] Descriptions of this injury date back to at least 20 BC by Meges of Sidon.[8]
 Symptoms include knee pain.[2] The joint may also be obviously out of place.[2] A joint effusion is not always present.[2]
 Complications may include injury to the artery behind the knee in about 20% of cases or compartment syndrome.[3][4] Damage to the common peroneal nerve or tibial nerve may also occur.[2] Nerve problems if they occur often never fully heal.[10]
 About half are the result of major trauma and about half occur as a result of minor trauma.[3] Major trauma may include mechanisms like falls from a significant height, motor vehicle collisions, or a pedestrian being hit by a motor vehicle.[2] Cases due to major trauma often have other injuries.[5]
 Minor trauma may include tripping while walking or while playing sports.[2] Risk factors include obesity.[2]
 The condition may also occur in a number of genetic disorders such as Ellis–van Creveld syndrome, Larsen syndrome, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.[11]
 As the injury may reduce on its own before a person arrives at the hospital, the diagnosis may be missed.[2] Diagnosis may be suspected based on the history of the injury and a physical examination.[5] This may include anterior drawer test, valgus stress test, varus stress test, and posterior sag test.[5] An accurate physical exam can be difficult due to pain.[5]
 Plain X-rays, CT scan, ultrasonography, or MRI may help with the diagnosis.[2][10] Findings on X-ray that may be useful among those who have already reduced include a variable joint space, subluxation of the joint, or a Segond fracture.[5]
 If the ankle–brachial pressure index (ABI) is less than 0.9, CT angiography is recommended.[3] Standard angiography may also be used.[2] If the ABI is greater than 0.9 repeated physical exams over the next 24 hours to verify good blood flow may be sufficient.[2][10] The ABI is calculated by taking the systolic blood pressure at the ankle and dividing it by the systolic blood pressure in the arm.[2]
 They may be divided into five types: anterior, posterior, lateral, medial, and rotatory.[4] This classification is based on the movement of the tibia with respect to the femur.[10] Anterior dislocations are the most common, followed by posterior dislocations.[2] They may also be classified based on what ligaments are damaged.[2]
 Initial management is often based on Advanced Trauma Life Support.[5] If the joint remains dislocated reduction and splinting is indicated.[4] Reduction can often be done with simple traction after the person has received procedural sedation.[10] If the joint cannot be reduced in the emergency department emergency surgery is recommended.[2]
 In those with signs of arterial injury immediate surgery is generally carried out.[3] If the joint does not stay reduced external fixation may be needed.[2] If the nerves and artery are intact the ligaments may be repaired after a few days.[10] Multiple surgeries may be required.[4] In just over 10% of cases an amputation of part of the leg is required.[4]
 Knee dislocations are rare: they represent about 1 in 5,000 orthopedic injuries,[5] and about 1 knee dislocation occurs annually per 100,000 people.[3]  Males are more often affected than females, and young adults are most often affected.[2]
"
Little League elbow,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Little_League_elbow,SI," Little League elbow is a condition that is caused by repetitive throwing motions, especially in children who play sports that involve an overhand throw. ""Little Leaguer's elbow"" was coined by Brogdon and Crow in an eponymous 1960 article in the American Journal of Radiology.[1]
 The name of the condition is derived from the game of baseball.  Compared to athletes who play other sports, baseball players are at higher risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization by children and teenagers.[2]
 Little League elbow is most often seen in young pitchers under the age of sixteen. The pitching motion causes a valgus stress to be placed on the elbow joint which can cause damage to the structures of the elbow, resulting in an avulsion of the medial epiphyseal plate (growth plate).
 The first diagnosis of the injury in 1960 set off a firestorm of controversy regarding how much youth baseball players can and should be asked to pitch. The ailment even appeared in the comic strip Peanuts in 1963 when Charlie Brown received a diagnosis.[3] In 2007, in order to protect against overuse injuries, Little League Baseball began limiting the number of pitches a player could throw per day.[4]
 Adult pitchers do not experience the same injury because they do not have an open growth plate in the elbow. Instead, in adult athletes a more common injury is to the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow, an injury that often requires Tommy John surgery in order for the athlete to resume high-level competitive throwing.

Physically unable to perform,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Physically_unable_to_perform,SI," Physically unable to perform (PUP) is a roster designation used in the National Football League for players who suffer from football-related injuries during the preseason. Players on the PUP list may participate in team meetings, and take advantage of the training and medical facilities, but cannot practice with the team.  There are two separate PUP lists: a preseason PUP list and a regular-season PUP list.
 A player who, as a result of football-related injuries, is unable to take part in training camp practices may be assigned to the preseason PUP list. Players can be moved off the PUP list to the active roster at any time, even after one practice. A player cannot be placed on the PUP list, however, once he has taken the field for a practice, even if only for a few minutes.
 A player who finishes the preseason still on the PUP list can then be placed on the regular-season PUP list. Such players must sit out the first six weeks of the regular season. At that point, teams have a five-week window in which to allow the player to begin practicing; from the day the player begins practicing, teams have an additional 21-day window in which to decide whether to activate the player to the 53-man roster. If either of those deadlines pass, the player must remain on the PUP list for the remainder of the season.[1]
 A similar list, known as the ""non-football injury"" (NFI) list, is functionally equivalent to PUP, but is used for players who are unable to practice as a result of conditions unrelated to football, or injuries that did not occur during an NFL game or practice. For example, New England Patriots tackle Marcus Cannon began his rookie season on the NFI list as he recovered from chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Willis McGahee spent his entire rookie season on the Buffalo Bills' NFI list due to the major knee injury he sustained in the 2003 Fiesta Bowl while in college.

Running injuries,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Running_injuries,SI," Running injuries affect about half of runners annually. The frequency of various RRI depend on the type of running, as runners vary significantly in factors such as speed and mileage. RRI can be both acute and chronic. Many of the common injuries that plague runners are chronic, developing over a longer period of time, as opposed to injury caused by sudden trauma, such as strains. These are often the result of overuse. Common overuse injuries include stress fractures, Achilles tendinitis, Iliotibial band syndrome, Patellofemoral pain (runners knee), and plantar fasciitis.
 Proper running form is important in injury prevention. A major aspect of running form is foot strike pattern. The way in which the foot makes contact with the ground determines how the force of the impact is distributed throughout the body. Different types of modern running shoes are created to manipulate foot strike pattern in an effort to reduce the risk of injury. In recent years, barefoot running has increased in popularity in many western countries, because of claims that it reduces the risk of injury. However, this has not been proven and is still debated.[1]
 In general, overuse injuries are the result of repetitive impact between the foot and the ground. With improper running form, the force of the impact can be distributed abnormally throughout the feet and legs. Running form tends to worsen with fatigue. When moving at a constant pace, a symmetrical gait is considered to be normal. Asymmetry is considered to be a risk factor for injury. One study attempted to quantify the change in running form between a rested and fatigued state by measuring asymmetrical running gait in the lower limbs. The results showed that ""knee internal rotation and knee stiffness became more asymmetrical with fatigue, increasing by 14% and 5.3%, respectively"".[2] These findings suggest that focusing on proper running form, particularly when fatigued, could reduce the risk of running-related injuries. Running in worn-out shoes may also increase the risk of injury and altering the footwear might be helpful. These injuries can also arise due to a sudden increase in the intensity or amount of exercise.
 Achilles tendinitis is the inflammation of the Achilles tendon, resulting in pain along the back of the leg near the heel. There are two types of Achilles tendinitis, insertional and noninsertional. Noninsertional Achilles tendinitis is the type that more commonly affects runners. In this case, inflammation is occurring in the middle portion of the tendon, whereas insertional Achilles tendinitis is inflammation located where the tendon connects (inserts) to the heel bone. Having tight calf muscles may also increase the risk of Achilles tendinitis. Stretching the calves before starting heavy exercise may help relieve tightness in the muscles.[3]
 Patellofemoral pain syndrome is associated with pain in the knee and around the patella. It is sometimes referred to as runner's knee, but this term is used for other overuse injuries that involve knee pain as well. It can be caused by a single incident but is often the result of overuse or a sudden increase in physical activity. 
 Iliotibial band syndrome is defined as inflammation of the iliotibial band on the outside of the knee. This inflammation occurs a result of the iliotibial band and the outside of the knee join rubbing together. The resulting pain typically is initially mild and worsens if running continues. Recurrence is a common issue with iliotibial band syndrome, as pain goes away with a period of rest, but symptoms can easily come back as the runner returns to training. During recovery, the muscles on the outside of the hip can be stretched to reduce tightness in the band.
 So-called 'traditional' running shoes are designed to give more support and cushion the landing to reduce the effects of impact. They allow for more comfortable running on hard surfaces such as asphalt and also protect the foot when stepping on rocks or other potentially sharp objects. However, the cushioning provided in traditional running shoes is thought to encourage a foot strike pattern, where the heel lands first. Heel striking generates a relatively large amount of impact force that can put different parts of the lower extremities under excessive stress.  
 Barefoot running has been promoted as one method of reducing the risk of running-related injuries. Barefoot running is thought to improve running form by encouraging forefoot striking. The collision of the forefoot with the ground generates a significantly smaller impact force in comparison to striking heel first.[4] However, barefoot running leaves the foot unprotected from stepping on sharp objects. Although running barefoot may reduce the risk of running-related injuries, it is important to take time while switching from running with shoes.  
 Beginning to run barefoot without reducing intensity or mileage of training can actually cause muscle or tendon injury. Changing one's style of running shoe or switching to barefoot running will most likely alter the foot strike pattern, meaning that the force of impact will be absorbed differently. Injuries are more likely to occur in novice barefoot runners. This may be a result of not yet having fully adapted to a new style of running, and therefore running with inconsistent technique. To measure this, a study was conducted involving runners who habitually run with a rearfoot strike while wearing shoes. Of the runners involved in the study, 32% used a heel strike pattern in initial attempts at running barefoot. Running barefoot while heel striking leads to increased muscle activation and impact accelerations.[5] The findings suggest that an inconsistency in running technique among novice barefoot runners may put them at a higher risk of injury in comparison to running with shoes.  
 Under some hypotheses, humans and their recent evolutionary ancestors may have needed to be able to run long distances in order to survive, and therefore natural selection would have favored traits that improve humans ability to run for long periods of time.   
 According to the endurance running hypothesis, long distance running has been suggested to have played a significant role in the lifestyle and evolution of early hominins. Before developing more advanced hunting tools such as the bow and arrow,  are thought to have used endurance running for scavenging and hunting. Persistence hunting is ""a form of pursuit hunting in which [the hunter uses] endurance running during the midday heat to drive [prey] into hyperthermia and exhaustion so they can easily be killed"".[6] Unlike many medium-to-large mammals that use panting as a form of evaporative cooling, hominins rely on sweating, allowing evaporation to occur on a much larger surface area. In this way, sweating results in better thermoregulation that allows the hominin to outlast the prey during the chase. This is one potential explanation for the loss of most body hair in humans. Those individuals with less body hair would be able to better thermoregulate while running to avoid overheating. For this species to exist under the endurance running hypothesis, running most likely did not result in the frequency of injuries that it does today, because such an injury to early hominins likely led to starvation. This example would imply that recent ancestors of humans experienced selective pressure to adapt to barefoot running.
 Minimalist shoes are an alternative option that can be seen as an intermediate between running barefoot or with traditional running shoes, as they lack the high cushioned heels of traditional running shoes. These shoes are also designed to encourage forefoot striking.[7] One study observed the redistribution of mechanical work with fast speed running in minimalist shoes compared to conventional shoes in 26 trained runners. The results showed that running at a fast pace in minimalist shoes caused a statistically significant redistribution of work from the knee to the ankle joint.[8] Therefore, switching to a minimalist running shoe may be beneficial in preventing recurrence for runners who have experienced a knee injury in the past. However, the switch could also increase the risk of ankle and calf injuries. As with to barefoot running, runners who chose to switch to minimalist shoes should not start out at full training intensity.

Sports-related traumatic brain injury,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Sports-related_traumatic_brain_injury,SI," A sports-related traumatic brain injury is a serious accident which may lead to significant morbidity or mortality. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in sports are usually a result of physical contact with another person or stationary object,[1] these sports may include boxing, football, field/ice hockey, lacrosse, martial arts, rugby, soccer, wrestling, auto racing, cycling, equestrian, roller blading, skateboarding, skiing, or snowboarding.[2][1]
 A study was completed identifying the severity and frequency of traumatic brain injuries occurred in high school sports:
 ""Of 23,566 reported injuries in the 10 sports during the 3-year study period, 1219 (5.5%) were MTBIs. Of the MTBIs, football accounted for 773 (63.4%) of cases; wrestling, 128 (10.5%); girls' soccer, 76 (6.2%); boys' soccer, 69 (5.7%); girls' basketball, 63 (5.2%); boys' basketball, 51 (4.2%); softball, 25 (2.1%); baseball, 15 (1.2%); field hockey, 13 (1.1%); and volleyball, 6 (0.5%). The injury rates per 100 player-seasons were 3.66 for football, 1.58 for wrestling, 1.14 for girls' soccer, 1.04 for girls' basketball, 0.92 for boys' soccer, 0.75 for boys' basketball, 0.46 for softball, 0.46 for field hockey, 0.23 for baseball, and 0.14 for volleyball. The median time lost from participation for all MTBIs was 3 days. There were 6 cases of subdural hematoma and intracranial injury reported in football. Based on these data, an estimated 62,816 cases of MTBI occur annually among high school varsity athletes participating in these sports, with football accounting for about 63% of cases.""[3]
 The most common TBIs in sports are cerebral contusions, second impact syndrome concussions, dementia pugilistica, and hematomas.[4]
 A concussion is defined as a stunning, damaging, or shattering effect from a hard blow; especially: a jarring injury of the brain resulting in disturbance of cerebral function.[5]  Concussions are also sometimes referred to as mTBI (Mild Traumatic Brain Injury). Concussions are injuries to the head which cause a temporary lapse in the normal operation of brain function. Concussions have many symptoms which could be displayed in a physical, psychological or emotional manner. Concussions symptoms can sometimes be hard to determine because they present in a subtle manner.[5]  A symposium was held in 2008 in Zurich, Switzerland where a definition for concussions was developed. A concussion is now defined as “a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical forces.”[6]
 There are five major features in conjunction with the definition:[6]
 (see concussion for more information)
 Signs and symptoms of concussions can be hard to determine because they may not present strongly and because they may not present for several hours after the incident has occurred. There are 4 categories that symptoms of a concussion can be classified within: physical, cognitive, emotional and sleep disturbance.[7]  The most common symptom is a headache as well as the feeling of being “fog like”. Other, more subtle symptoms that can accompany headaches are emotional changes, irritability, slowed reaction times and drowsiness.[7]  Accompanying symptoms can include sensitivity to light, and noise, fatigue, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The loss of consciousness is another identifiable characteristic of concussions but it is not a required symptom to diagnose it. The loss of consciousness occurs in only 10% of concussions, so it cannot be a reliable sign of a concussion.[8]  Other distinguishing characteristics of concussions are retrograde amnesia (loss of memory just prior to injury) and posttraumatic amnesia (impaired recall of time between the injury or resumption of consciousness and the point at which new memories are stored and retrieved).[7]
 There are many diagnostic tools and tests within sports. While the tests and scales may vary greatly from sport to sport, in the end, they effectively gain the same information regardless. The first initial assessment that should take place with every athlete found to be unconscious after head or neck trauma is the “ABC’s” (airway, breathing, and circulation). There is an array of initial sideline evaluations that can be conducted after a possible concussive incident such as Maddocks questions, Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), or Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2).[6]  “The Maddocks questions are a brief set of questions to evaluate orientation as well as short and long-term memory related to the sport and current game. The questions are for sideline use only and are included in the SCAT2.”[6]  The BESS test is a test based on an athlete's posture. There are 3 positions that the athlete tests in and a composite score of their errors over the 6 rounds of testing determines their scores.[6]  The SCAT2 uses both the BESS and SAC test. The SAC and SCAT-2 evaluations also contain symptoms checklists which can determine immediate cognitive and motor deficits, although many symptoms may present hours after the initial injury. 85% of certified athletic trainers use symptom checklists as part of a concussion assessment according to a recent survey.[9]
 Limited research of the test since its release from the Zurich Concussion statement has not allowed it to be verified as a successful testing method.[6] The SAC however, does have sufficient evidence regarding its reliability, with researchers finding the test having a test-retest reliability of 53%.[9] Many major professional sports organizations like the NFL, NHL, MLB and NBA have taken stronger looks at in game concussions through extensive studies to develop safer equipment and playing conditions for the players. In doing this they have developed their own initial sideline testing and concussion protocols. The NFL has adopted a standardized testing evaluation form based on the SCAT2 that it has implemented into all head and neck trauma incidents.[10]  In 2011 the NFL changed their concussion protocol and built upon their previous SCAT2 standardized test. “The new implementations include a focused screening neurological examination to exclude cervical spine and intracranial bleeding, assessment of orientation, immediate and delayed recall, concentration, as well as a balance evaluation.”[11]
 Similarly, in 2011, the NHL adopted a new league-wide concussion protocol which would remove players from the bench, who may have possibly sustained head or neck trauma, and bring them back to an undisclosed quiet room. Players would be held there for a minimum of 15 minutes while completing tests similar of those to the NFL's testing protocol.[12]  In 2007 Major League Baseball also adopted a concussion program for umpires and players. In 2011 the policy was revised and 4 new features were added to the program. The first of which is that all umpires and players are to conduct baseline testing during spring training or after a player signing.[13]  Secondly, the SCAT2 has been adopted as the official sideline test for all MLB teams. Thirdly, a 7-day disabled list has been set up for players with concussions; players on the list for 14 days are moved to the 15-day disabled list. Lastly, the leagues medical director must clear all players who have suffered a concussion before they can return to play.[13]  Of the four major professional sports in the U.S., the NBA is the only league to have not adopted a sideline concussion policy. Each team and their medical staff proceed differently with their policies.
 Short-term effects deal mostly with Post-concussion Syndrome, which has no clearly defined definition. A person suffering from a single concussive incident typically has a strong recovery rate. The most common Post-concussion symptom is a persistent headache which usually disappears within 1–2 weeks.[14]  Other common short-term effects include dizziness, vomiting, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, irritability, cognitive lapses and memory impairment.[6]  20-90% of the persons affected develop one symptom within a month of the incident, after 3 months 40% of the affected persons show at least 3 symptoms.[14]
 Receiving multiple concussive incidents has long been known to cause a cumulative effect on the brain. It is also known that each successive concussion makes it easier to obtain another concussion in the future.[14]  Receiving multiple concussions can lead to long-term memory loss, psychiatric disorders, brain damage and other neurological disorders.[14]  There are no clearly defined guidelines for the retirement of an athlete, but it has been proposed that an athlete who sustains 3 concussive incidents in a single season or has post-concussion symptoms for more than 3 months should consider a lengthy period away from the sport.[14]  Especially with sports, when multiple concussions are received it is likely that a doctor will advise the player in question to avoid returning to sports where contact is possible.[6]
 Second-impact syndrome (SIS) occurs when an athlete sustains a second concussive incident before the symptoms of a prior concussive incident have fully healed.[6]  It does not take a severe concussion to cause SIS, even a mild grade concussion can lead to it. The condition is often fatal, and if death does not occur severe disability is probable.  SIS is most often developed in young athletes, who are thought to be particularly vulnerable.
 Helmets
 Throughout the progression of contact sports, there have been continual innovations in protective gear, especially in terms of limiting head and neck traumas. The earliest known use of football helmets is documented in an 1893 Army–Navy game.[15]    Early helmets were typically only constructed of leather padding. Throughout the early 1900s helmets developed to include metal and plastics to better protect the player.[15]  In 1939 helmets became mandatory for college players, and a year later the NFL adopted the same policy. The increasing development and standardization of helmets along with rule changes that would protect players, would eventually cut down on head and neck traumas.[15]  In 2012 testing is being conducted on a new type of helmet which battles rotational acceleration which is linked closer to concussions than typical impacts. This helmet is called the Multidirectional Impact Protection System (MIPS).[16]  This new generation of helmet is shown to decrease rotational acceleration by 55% compared to the traditional football helmet.[16]  Like the NFL the NHL took steps to protecting players by mandating helmets in 1979.  As of 2009 about 60% of NHL players currently wear a half visor for upper face protection.[17]
 Mouth Guards
 Many sports including football, ice hockey, lacrosse, field hockey, and boxing implemented mandatory mouth guard policies during the 1960s and '70s. These policies were introduced to cut down on a player's chance of orofacial injury and concussions.[15]  Several studies conducted in many various professional and collegiate sports have yet to validate the claim that mouth guards cut down on concussions; although a study conducted by the NHL showed that symptom severity had significantly decreased with the use of mouth guards.[15]
 Cerebral contusions are bruises to the brain caused by a direct blow to the head causing the brain to bounce against the inside of the skull and bruise brain tissue.[18]  The force of the blow causes either a tearing or twisting of the structure and blood vessels which hinders the ability of the receptors to send feedback to the brain.  With the tearing or twisting of structure, the brain begins to swell and bleed.  Since the brain cavity has no room to expand due to the swelling, bruises begin to form.  Due to the nature of the injury, most of the contusive damage is found deeper in the brain.[19]
 In sports, most cerebral contusions are caused when the brain is either suddenly accelerated, decelerated, or strikes an immovable object.[20]  When the blow happens, brain tissue can be damaged, sometimes resulting in the need for hospitalization and surgery.  A resection of the contused tissue is needed within surgery pending the severity of the incident.  The highest rates of contusions occur in men between the ages of 15 to 24, somewhat due to their aggressive nature.[21]  If a person sustains a contusion one time, they are more likely to sustain a repeated one.[22]
 (see cerebral contusion for more information)
 In the heat of a game, it may be hard to see or feel symptoms relating to cerebral contusions.  If any of these signs are visible or as an athlete, you feel them, remove yourself from competition immediately.  Cerebral contusions and other injuries can occur in any sport, not just in the traditional “collision” sports.  According to the USCPSC, four of the top five sports that cause brain injuries are considered to have limited brain contact: basketball, bicycling, baseball, and playground activities.[23]  The most popular sport to cause cerebral contusions is American football due to the drastic acceleration/deceleration of the brain.
 If any of these symptoms are felt or noticed, a hospital visit is needed where further machine testing is done.[25]  In boxing, the rapid deceleration of the brain after an impact causes the symptoms to progress much faster or at a more traumatic rate. Doctors ringside monitor a boxer's attitude and brain function throughout the fight and are able to stop the match following startling news.[26]
 Contusions are identified with two forms of diagnosis: acceleration of the brain and direct trauma.  A direct trauma injury is much more severe than an acceleration injury (in most cases) and requires much more intensive diagnosis and testing.  The full extent of the injury may not be known until testing done in a hospital is complete.
 In football, medical trainers are well versed to diagnose symptoms pertaining to a traumatic brain injury.  They are not, however, able to determine what type of injury it is or the extent the injury stems.  Football trainers can medically clear or not clear players based on brain injury symptoms.  If a trainer feels that certain symptoms exist that are similar to that of cerebral contusions, they will take the player out of the game and rush them to the hospital.  Upon admission into the hospital, a CT scan will be ordered.  A CT scan is the quickest method to diagnose cerebral contusions because it can be performed immediately and have fairly exact findings.[21]  The best method, as suggested by medical doctors, is an MRI because they present more sensitive and accurate findings.  MRI's, however, must be scheduled and cannot be completed immediately following the injury.  MRI's also take a long time to perform where the injury a player sustained may get worse within that time frame.
 History:[22] The individual is possibly unconscious when examined by medical personnel on the field. A common symptom is prolonged unconsciousness (coma), however this player reports headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and weakness of the extremities (paresis) and makes inappropriate responses to questions.
 Physical exam: The individual's level of consciousness is disturbed. A neurological examination may not reveal any localizing signs. The individual with no other serious injuries than cerebral contusion will not have a fractured skull or any signs of opening or penetration of the skull.
 Tests: Skull x-rays check for a fracture. CT or MRI detect any bleeding in the skull. The Glasgow Coma Scale classifies the severity of brain injury, with a score of 15 as normal and progressively lower scores indicating greater neurologic injury to the brain.
 After testing is completed, doctors will make an estimate on the extent of the injury and possible recovery time.  If cranial bleeding and swelling is minor, a short hospital stay (up to a week) is needed with close observation.  If bleeding is severe, the player may be treated as a patient with a severe head injury (with surgery as the main option). This process requires the patient to be admitted into an intinsive care unity with close monitoring of blood levels and brain activity.[20]
 The effects of a cerebral contusion depend on the cause of the injury and what part of the brain was most affected.  Outcomes vary from minor injuries that require short recovery times to severe injuries that can lead to death.[24]  Short-term effects of cerebral contusions can range from a mild headache to feeling lightheaded for a few days.  Most short-term effects match that of a mild head injury while long-term effects can be much more serious.  Most long-term injuries require surgery, rehabilitation, and close monitoring.  In small cases, cerebral contusions can lead to death (about 15 per 100,000 people).  If a cerebral contusion leads to a coma, recovery can be very long and rehabilitation extensive.  If the coma is long, the probability of dying or permanent neurological damage is very possible.[22]
 Rules exist within each sport to help prevent cerebral contusions and traumatic brain injuries.  However, individual athletes are the best prevention against their own injuries.  In a game, athletes notice when they have the symptoms of a cerebral contusion and should take themselves out of the game.  It may be hard for medical personnel or coaches to notice when a player has a traumatic brain injury, so it is in the player's best interest to be removed from play.[27]  In hockey, traumatic brain injuries constitute 10%-15% of all head injuries.  With the high percent of injuries being traumatic, extensive design improvements have been made to helmets.  These improvements reduce the risk of cerebral contusions by providing more padding around the skull and a chin strap that keeps the helmet snug.[28]  In baseball, major improvements to helmets have been made to protect batters from the impact a baseball can have when hitting their head.[29]  Helmets, before this major improvement, were designed to withstand a velocity of 70 mph from a pitch or foul ball.  Since the company Rawlings’ new design, helmets can withstand a velocity of 100 mph and have further padding around the softer parts on the side of the skull.
 A syndrome affecting boxers that is caused by cumulative cerebral injuries and is characterized by impaired cognitive processes (as thinking and remembering), Parkinsonism, impaired and often slurred speech, and slow poorly coordinated movements especially of the legs. Dementia Pugilistica, more commonly known as “Punch Drunk Syndrome”, is a degenerative brain disorder resulting from head trauma. Dementia Pugilistica (DP) is typically associated with the sport of boxing; although symptoms of DP may appear immediately after a single traumatic brain injury, they are typically described following the cessation of exposure to chronic brain injury.[30]
 Some of the subjective symptoms experienced after a Knockout are headaches, tinnitus, forgetfulness, impaired hearing, dizziness, nausea and impaired gait. Approximately ten percent of these active boxers reported constantly suffering from forgetfulness, headaches and other symptoms.[31]  Symptoms can be progressive and can develop late into a boxer's career or possibly years into retirement.[32]  Some of the earlier symptoms of “punch drunk syndrome” are noticeable in extremities; such as trembling hands or feet, or an instability in equilibrium.[33]  Signs of chronic brain damage can also affect irritability, paranoia and cause violent outbursts.[34]
 Dementia pugilistica is difficult to diagnose until the later stages of a boxer's life. Symptoms are not apparent until boxer's are years into retirement.[32]  The damage is done in four primary sites of the brain: the septal regions, the cerebellum, the substantia nigra and the neurons. The septa end up separated and torn apart while the ventricles become enlarged. “The main motor pathways in the cerebellum and substantia nigra are affected, as well as the foramen magnum.""[35]  Lastly, the neurons in the brains of boxer's have a “bizarre tendency for many neurons, mainly in the deep temporal grey matter, to develop abnormal neurofibrils called Alzheimer tangle.[35]  The most successful way to diagnose DP is through magnetic resonance imaging techniques, more commonly known as an MRI.  Segmented inversion recovery ratio imaging technique is based on the ratio of a white matter suppressed image and gray matter suppressed image.[36]  “The (SIRRIM) technique improves the differentiation of gray matter from white matter and is sensitive to detect abnormalities of intracellular space, including changes during cellular death.”[37]
 Multiple studies have concluded that there is neurological evidence of damage to pyramidal, extrapyramidal and cerebellar systems with associated psychosis, memory loss or dementia, personality change and social instability.[38]  After fighting, boxers show raised cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurofilament light chain and total tau then they did after three months with no boxing.[39][unreliable medical source]
 Protective measures have been taken especially in amateur boxing, such as the wearing of a head guard, more heavily cushioned gloves (weighing 10 ounces in amateur boxing and 8 ounces in professional boxing), shorter and fewer rounds, the addition of the ‘outclassed rule’ (where the point difference becomes greater than 20), and the option for the boxer to interrupt the fight itself.[38]
 A hematoma is a localized collection of blood that gathers outside the blood vessels in an area it does not belong.[40]  Specifically a hematoma is tissue damage due to acceleration or deceleration from unrestricted movement, in which the result is shearing of the brain tissue.[41]  Two types of hematomas occurring within the brain are: subdural and extradural hematomas, which are classified as a traumatic brain injury (TBI).  When a direct blow to the head occurs, there is bruising to the brain and damage to the internal tissue and blood vessels. Additionally, the jarring of the brain against the skull causes hematomas.[42]  Injuries commonly occur during contact sport such as boxing, football, basketball, motor cycling, scuba diving, mountaineering, hang gliding, skydiving, and horseback riding. Council on scientific affairs.[43]    Following a serve brain injury or a skull fracture one of the two hematomas may occur. An extradural hematoma is a TBI where blood collects between the inside of the skull and the dura, the thick outer covering of the brain.[44]  A subdural hematoma is a localized collection of blood under the surface of the dura matter.  Blood collects on the outermost layer of the brain and creates an intracranial pressure.
 Generally, symptoms for hematomas are confused speech, difficulty with balance or walking, headaches, lethargy or confusion, nausea or vomiting, numbness, seizures, slurred speech, visual disturbances, and weakness.[42]  For example, an athlete who experiences a subdural hematoma will experience loss of consciousness with little or no lucidity. Pupils are often dilated or unequal. Additionally, hemiparesis, seizure activity, and vomiting, may be apparent.[45]  An epidural hematoma typically results in serve a headache which is followed by a brief loss of consciousness and variable levels of lucidness. This may last for several hours while the brain function deteriorates. If untreated epidural hematoma causes increased blood pressure, shortness of breath, damage to brain function and may result in death.[46]
 Subdural and epidural hematomas are serious conditions and should be immediately diagnosed and treated by a physician. Hematomas may not show the full extent of the problem initially after the head injury, but it may be revealed after comprehensive medical evaluation and diagnostic test.  Diagnostic test may include: blood test, x-ray, computed tomography scan (CT/CAT scan), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[42]  The two most important diagnostic tests are the CT scan and the MRI. The CT scan reveals evidence of blood within the skull, fractures, and signs of compression on the brain from the hematoma. The MRI is a more thorough evaluation of injuries to the brain tissue. Yet, a MRI cannot take place if the injured victim is in a confused state.[47]  Small hematomas may not require surgery if there is no pressure on the brain and minimal symptoms. Small hematomas may be monitored closely to ensure the hematoma is not enlarging and resolved properly.[47]  A large hematoma larger than 1 cm at its thickest point produces severe headaches and brain function deterioration requires immediate surgery by a neurosurgeon. Surgery reduces the pressure within the brain and stops the bleeding.[46]
 The most crutial aspect for recovery in patients with severe hematomas is rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment.[46]  Once the clot has been removed the intracranial pressure is monitored for several days. Conditions which are also monitored after surgery are seizures, clot accumulation, and infection. If complications do occur, sometime the hematoma needs to be re-drained.[47]  Additional complications following a surgical or nonsurgical treatment may include temporary or permanent weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, memory loss, dizziness, headache, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, seizures, and/or brain herniation.[44]  The most helpful predictors of the treatment outcome is the glasgow coma scale (GCS).  This is a standardized pupil response assessment of the neurologic status of the patient. GCS helps assess many different types of head injuries and predicts how a patient will recover following a hematoma. Factors such as elevated intracranial pressure, increased patients age, and abnormal GCS results lead to a poor prognosis. The mortality rate following a hematoma could be as high as 80% and survivors many not regain the same pre-injury function.[47]  Subdural and epidural hematomas are serious injuries and recovery varies widely depending on the severity of the hematoma.[46]  Severity depends on type and location of the injury, the size of the blood collection, and how quickly treatment is obtained.[44]  Hence, it is difficult to determine when an athlete can return to sports after his/her injury. A variety of multidisciplinary people such as sports medicine physicians, neurologist/neurosurgeons, athletic trainers, coaches, and family require input. If an athlete is approved to return, he or she is required to complete asymptomatic at rest and with exertion. The athlete also has to clear a CT scan indicating the hematoma has entirely resolved. Lastly, the athlete needs to be slowly brought back into the sport with close monitoring to be sure the symptoms do not recur.[47]
 Preemptive measures include using safety equipment to reduce your risk of a head injury. Equipment examples are hard hats, bicycle or motorcycle helmets, and seat belts. To reduce the risk of hematomas, factors to avoid are taking anticoagulant medication (blood thinners, such as aspirin), long-term abuse of alcohol, repeated falls, and reoccurring head injury.[44]

Swimming injuries,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Swimming_injuries,SI," Swimming injuries have many different causes, which can occur immediate or can occur as the result of a long-term swimming career. Some ways that swimmers can increase the risk of an injury are by overuse of a specific part of the body, lacking crucial flexibility and strength, etc. These injuries, like swimmer’s shoulder and breaststroker’s knee, cause pain to the swimmer in certain regions that permit necessary movement for the required precise technique. Although these injuries can halt a professional swimmer’s career, many can be treated and some can even be prevented. There are different procedures and exercises that can either prevent an injury or help with recovering from an injury. Many of the exercises are specific to the injury and vary in helpfulness according to the person and the technique used for the exercise.
 Compared to athletes who play other sports, competitive swimmers are at higher than average risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization among children and teenagers.[1]
 Swimmers shoulder is the name given to a broad range of shoulder injuries that occur in swimmers and results in pain felt within the shoulder and in areas surrounding the shoulder, including down the arm and up the neck.[2] Pain associated with swimmers shoulder often starts as an irritating niggle when swim training and can persist to intense pain while swim training and also a constant pain while resting.[3]
 While there are a number of contributing factor leading to the development of swimmers shoulder, it is believed that the two main causes of swimmers shoulder are overuse and the biomechanics of the stroke also known as stroke technique.
 The first cause of swimmers shoulder is overuse. Overuse of the shoulder muscles and surrounding muscles can lead to fatigue of the muscles. Due to the muscles being fatigued they are in a weakened state and with continuous use will therefore work less effectively when swimming and will result in the swimmer having to work the shoulder muscles twice as hard by taking double the number of strokes they would usually take in order to cover the same distance. This would ultimately result in more fatigue and inflammation of the muscles. Unilateral breathing may also cause swimmers shoulder due to the fact that the opposite shoulder to the breathing arm has to work harder to support balanced position and forward movement while the head is turned.  Some training equipment such as paddles and kick boards can also put stress on the shoulder and surrounding muscles and cause fatigue and inflammation.[4]
 The second cause of swimmer shoulder is the biomechanics of the stroke also known as stroke technique. Incorrect stroke technique for example the swimmers hand entering the water across the mid-line of the swimmers body then proceeding to stroke back or the swimmers hand entering the water palm out thumb down and any other type of incorrect technique when done repetitively can cause pain, fatigue and inflammation of the shoulder and surrounding muscles.[4]
 Some treatment methods include; warming up slowly prior to training, avoiding strokes and positions that cause pain (butterfly/freestyle), fixing any bad technique that could be causing the pain, adjusting the distance and frequency of training to avoid further overuse of the muscles, discontinue the use of paddles, increase kick sets to allow the shoulder to rest however limit the use of kickboards and avoid pulling sets. Increase the use of fins to assist with maintaining a good body position and to avoid drag, avoid dry land upper body weight training, ice the shoulder daily, consider the use of anti-inflammatory creams and medicines and seek the advice of a medical professional.[5]
 Breastroker’s knee is the name given to pain felt within and around the knee that is experienced by swimmers. It is named this due to the fact it is most commonly only breastrokers that experience pain within the knee and around the knee. Most swimmer will have no problems with their knees however ‘the majority (86%) of breaststroke swimmers will have experienced knee pain at one point in their career and 47.2% of them will have had this problem at least one time every week.’ [6]
 There are several factors that increase the swimmers chances of developing knee pain and inflammation of the knee muscles such as, the increasing age of the swimmer, the length of the competitive career, the length of the event, inadequate warm-up, strength imbalance of hip abductors/adductors and flexibility imbalance of hip abductors/adductors.[6]
 In order to prevent the development of knee pain and inflammation of the knee muscles it is recommended that swimmers use a well-designed strength and stretching program, warm-up adequately, use correct breastroke kick technique, gradually build up the distance of breastroke swimming and have a balanced training program that focuses on not only breastroke and also has training sessions that allows for adequate recovery of the knee muscles to prevent fatigue of the muscles causing overuse, inflammation and pain.[6]
 Treatment of breastroker’s knee includes resting the knee muscles, icing daily, elevating the limb, strengthening and stretching, support e.g. strapping or knee braces, seeking medical advice which can lead to physiotherapy, cortisone injections and in few cases surgery.[6]

Tennis elbow,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Tennis_elbow,SI," Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a condition in which the outer part of the elbow becomes painful and tender.[1] The pain may also extend into the back of the forearm and grip strength may be weak.[2][1] Onset of symptoms is generally gradual.[2] Golfer's elbow is a similar condition that affects the inside of the elbow.[1]
 It is due to excessive use of the muscles of the back of the forearm.[2] Typically this occurs as a result of work or sports, classically racquet sports.[1][2] The diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms with medical imaging used to rule out other potential causes.[2] It is more likely if pain increases when a person tries to bend back their wrist when their wrist is held in a neutral position.[1] It is classified as a chronic tendinosis, not a tendinitis.[1]
 Treatment involves decreasing activities that bring on the symptoms together with physical therapy.[1] Pain medications such as NSAIDS or acetaminophen may be used.[1] A brace over the upper forearm may also be helpful.[2] If the condition does not improve corticosteroid injections or surgery may be recommended.[1] Many people get better within one month to two years.[3][4]
 About 2% of people are affected.[3] Those 30 to 50 years old are most commonly affected.[2] The condition was initially described in 1873.[3] The name ""lawn tennis elbow"" first came into use for the condition in 1882.[5]
 Symptoms associated with tennis elbow include, but are not limited to, radiating pain from the outside of the elbow to the forearm and wrist, pain during extension of wrist, weakness of the forearm, a painful grip while shaking hands or torquing a doorknob, and not being able to hold relatively heavy items in the hand.[7] The pain is similar to the condition known as golfer's elbow, but the latter occurs at the medial side of the elbow.[8]
 The term ""tennis elbow"" is widely used (although informal), but the condition should be understood as not limited to tennis players.[9][10]  The medical term ""lateral epicondylitis"" is most commonly used for the condition.[2][9][10][11]
 Since histological findings reveal noninflammatory tissue, the term “lateral elbow tendinopathy,"" ""tendinosis,” or “angio-fibroblastic tendinosis” have been suggested instead of “lateral epicondylitis”.[12][13]
 Tennis elbow is a type of repetitive strain injury resulting from tendon overuse and failed healing of the tendon. In addition, the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle plays a key role.[13][14]
 Early experiments suggested that tennis elbow was primarily caused by overexertion. However, studies show that trauma such as direct blows to the epicondyle, a sudden forceful pull, or forceful extension cause more than half of these injuries.[15] Repeatedly mis-hitting a tennis ball in the early stages of learning the sport causes shock to the elbow joint and may contribute to contracting the condition.[16]
 Histological findings include granulation tissue, microrupture, degenerative changes, and there is no traditional inflammation.[13][17][4]
 Longitudinal sonogram of the lateral elbow displays thickening and heterogeneity of the common extensor tendon that is consistent with tendinosis, as the ultrasound reveals calcifications, intrasubstance tears, and marked irregularity of the lateral epicondyle. Although the term “epicondylitis” is frequently used to describe this disorder, most histopathologic findings of studies have displayed no evidence of an acute, or a chronic inflammatory process. Histologic studies have demonstrated that this condition is the result of tendon degeneration, which replaces normal tissue with a disorganized arrangement of collagen. Therefore, the disorder is more appropriately referred to as tendinosis or tendinopathy rather than tendinitis.[12]
 Colour Doppler ultrasound reveals structural tendon changes, with vascularity and hypo-echoic areas that correspond to the areas of pain in the extensor origin.[18]
 The pathophysiology of lateral epicondylitis is degenerative.  Non-inflammatory, chronic degenerative changes of the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle are identified in surgical pathology specimens.[19] It is unclear if the pathology is affected by prior injection of corticosteroid.
 Tennis players generally believe tennis elbow is caused by the repetitive nature of hitting thousands of tennis balls, which leads to tiny tears in the forearm tendon attachment at the elbow.[11]
 The extensor digiti minimi also has a small origin site medial to the elbow that this condition can affect. The muscle involves the extension of the little finger and some extension of the wrist allowing for adaption to ""snap"" or flick the wrist—usually associated with a racquet swing. Most often, the extensor muscles become painful due to tendon breakdown from over-extension.  Improper form or movement allows for power in a swing to rotate through and around the wrist—creating a moment on that joint instead of the elbow joint or rotator cuff. This moment causes pressure to build impact forces to act on the tendon causing irritation and inflammation.
 At least one author questions that lateral epicondylitis is caused by repetitive microtrauma/overuse, maintaining the theory is likely overstated and lacks scientific support.[19]
 Other speculative risk factors for lateral epicondylitis include taking up tennis later in life, unaccustomed strenuous activity, decreased mental chronometry and speed and repetitive eccentric contraction of muscle (controlled lengthening of a muscle group).
 To diagnose tennis elbow, physicians perform a battery of tests in which they place pressure on the affected area while asking the patient to move the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Diagnosis is made by clinical signs and symptoms that are discrete and characteristic. For example, when the elbow fully extended, the patient feels points of tenderness over the affected point on the elbow. The most common location of tenderness is at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle from the lateral epicondyle (extensor carpi radialis brevis origin), 1 cm distal and slightly anterior to the lateral epicondyle.[6]  There is also pain with passive wrist flexion and resistive wrist extension (Cozen's test).[20]
 X-rays can confirm and distinguish possibilities of existing causes of pain that are unrelated to tennis elbow, such as fracture or arthritis. Rarely, calcification can be found where the extensor muscles attach to the lateral epicondyle.[6] Medical ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are other valuable tools for diagnosis but are frequently avoided due to the high cost.[8] MRI screening can confirm excess fluid and swelling in the affected region in the elbow, such as the connecting point between the forearm bone and the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle.
 Where lateral epicondylitis is caused by playing tennis, another factor of tennis elbow injury is experience and ability. The proportion of players who reported a history of tennis elbow had an increased number of playing years. As for ability, poor technique increases the chance for injury much like any sport. Therefore, an individual must learn proper technique for all aspects of their sport. The competitive level of the athlete also affects the incidence of tennis elbow. Class A and B players had a significantly higher rate of tennis elbow occurrence compared to class C and novice players.  However, an opposite, but not statistically significant, trend is observed for the recurrence of previous cases, with an increasingly higher rate as ability level decreases.[8]
 Other ways to prevent tennis elbow:
 Vibration dampers (otherwise known as ""gummies"") are not believed to be a reliable preventative measure. Rather, proper weight distribution in the racket is thought to be a more viable option in negating shock.[22]
 Evidence for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis before 2010 was poor.[23] There were clinical trials addressing many proposed treatments, but the trials were of poor quality.[24]
 In some cases, severity of tennis elbow symptoms mend without any treatment, within six to 24 months. Tennis elbow left untreated can lead to chronic pain that degrades quality of daily living.[8]
 There are several recommendations regarding prevention, treatment, and avoidance of recurrence that are largely speculative including stretches and progressive strengthening exercises to prevent re-irritation of the tendon[25] and other exercise measures.[26]
 One way to help treat minor cases of tennis elbow is to simply relax the affected arm. The rest lets stress and tightness within the forearm slowly relax and eventually have the arm in working condition—in a day or two, depending on the case.
 Eccentric exercise using a rubber bar is highly effective at eliminating pain and increasing strength.[27][28] The exercise involves grasping a rubber bar, twisting it, then slowly untwisting it.[27][29] Although it can be considered an evidence-based practice, long-term results have not yet been determined.[30]
 Moderate evidence exists demonstrating that joint manipulation directed at the elbow and wrist and spinal manipulation directed at the cervical and thoracic spinal regions results in clinical changes to pain and function.[31][32] There is also moderate evidence for short-term and mid-term effectiveness of cervical and thoracic spine manipulation as an add-on therapy to concentric and eccentric stretching plus mobilisation of wrist and forearm. Although not yet conclusive, the short-term analgesic effect of manipulation techniques may allow more vigorous stretching and strengthening exercises, resulting in a better and faster recovery process of the affected tendon in lateral epicondylitis.[33]
 Low level laser therapy, administered at specific doses and wavelengths directly to the lateral elbow tendon insertions, may result in short-term pain relief and less disability.[34]
 Orthosis is a device externally used on the limb to improve the function or reduce the pain. Orthotics may be useful in tennis elbow, however long-term effects are unknown.[35] There are two main types of orthoses prescribed for this problem: counterforce elbow orthoses and wrist extension orthoses.
 Counterforce orthosis has a circumferential structure surrounding the arm. This orthosis usually has a strap which applies a binding force over the origin of the wrist extensors. The applied force by orthosis reduces the elongation within the musculotendinous fibers. Wrist extensor orthosis maintains the wrist in the slight extension. This position reduces the overloading strain at the lesion area.
 Studies indicated both type of orthoses improve the hand function[36] and reduce the pain[37] in people with tennis elbow.
Extracorporeal shockwave therapy, while safe, is of unclear benefit.[38][39]
 Although anti-inflammatories are a commonly prescribed treatment for tennis elbow, the evidence for their effect is usually anecdotal with only limited studies showing a benefit.[40] A systematic review found that topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may improve pain in the short term (up to 4 weeks) but was unable to draw firm conclusions due to methodological issues.[41] Evidence for oral NSAIDs is mixed.[41]
 Evidence is poor for long term improvement from injections of any type, whether corticosteroids, botulinum toxin, prolotherapy or other substances.[42] Corticosteroid injection may be effective in the short term[43] however are of little benefit after a year, compared to a wait-and-see approach.[44] A recent randomized control trial comparing the effect of corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy, or a combination of corticosteroid injection and physiotherapy found that patients treated with corticosteroid injection versus placebo had lower complete recovery or improvement at 1 year (Relative risk 0.86). Patients that received corticosteroid injection also had a higher recurrence rate at 1 year versus placebo (54% versus 12%, relative risk 0.23).[45]
Complications from repeated steroid injections include skin problems such as hypopigmentation and fat atrophy leading to indentation of the skin around the injection site.[43] Steroid injections against appear to be more effective than shock wave therapy.[46] Botulinum toxin type A to paralyze the forearm extensor muscles in those with chronic tennis elbow that has not improved with conservative measures may be viable.[47]
 In recalcitrant cases surgery may be an option.[48][49][50] Surgical methods include:[51]
 Surgical techniques for lateral epicondylitis can be done by open surgery, percutaneous surgery or arthroscopic surgery, with no evidence that any particular type is better or worse than another.[49] Side effects include infection, damage to nerves and inability to straighten the arm.[52]
 Response to initial therapy is common, but so is relapse (25% to 50%) and/or prolonged, moderate discomfort (40%).
 Depending upon severity and quantity of multiple tendon injuries that have built up, the extensor carpi radialis brevis may not be fully healed by conservative treatment.  Nirschl defines four stages of lateral epicondylitis, showing the introduction of permanent damage beginning at Stage 2.
 In tennis players, about 39.7% have reported current or previous problems with their elbow. Less than one quarter (24%) of these athletes under the age of 50 reported that the tennis elbow symptoms were ""severe"" and ""disabling,"" while 42% were over the age of 50. More women (36%) than men (24%) considered their symptoms severe and disabling.  Tennis elbow is more prevalent in individuals over 40, where there is about a four-fold increase among men and two-fold increase among women.  Tennis elbow equally affects both sexes and, although men have a marginally higher overall prevalence rate as compared to women, this is not consistent within each age group, nor is it a statistically significant difference.[54]
 Playing time is a significant factor in tennis elbow occurrence, with increased incidence with increased playing time being greater for respondents under 40. Individuals over 40 who played over two hours doubled their chance of injury. Those under 40 increased it 3.5 fold compared to those who played less than two hours per day.[8]
 German physician F. Runge[55] is usually credited for the first description of the condition, calling it ""writer's cramp"" (Schreibekrampf) in 1873.[56]  Later, it was called ""washer women's elbow"".[57] British surgeon Henry Morris published an article in The Lancet describing ""lawn tennis arm"" in 1883.[58][59] The popular term ""tennis elbow"" first appeared the same year in a paper by H. P. Major, described as ""lawn-tennis elbow"".[60][61]

Tennis injuries,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Tennis_injuries,SI," Muscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis.[1] When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount of pressure to the lengthened muscle which can result in the occurrence of muscle strain.[2] Inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle strain occur which resulted in redness, pain and swelling.[2] Overuse is also common in tennis players from all level. Muscle, cartilage, nerves, bursae, ligaments and tendons may be damaged from overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recover in the most common case among the injury.[2]
 Lateral epicondylitis is an overuse injury that frequently occur in tennis. It is also known as tennis elbow. This injury categorise as tendon injury where it occur in the forearm muscle called the extensor carpic radialis brevis (ECRB).[3] The injury is regularly developed in the recreational players.[3] Experienced players are less likely to develop lateral epicondylitis than the inexperienced players due to poorer technique.[4] 	Tennis elbow or lateral epicondylalgia is a common injury that occurs in 40-50% of tennis players. It is more prominent at the lower levels of play and usually comes from any incorrect use of the wrist or grip on the forehand or one-handed backhand strokes[18].  Players at higher levels often have more relaxed grips and have a larger racquet extension out to the ball after they make contact, where professionals have less emphasis on the arm and more on the use of every part of the body in order exert the natural power behind the ball, lower level players don’t get the training to discover how to use their whole body for a tennis stroke and are often reduced to using their arms in order to exert all of the power therefore putting heavy strain on the arm[18]. Holding the grip tightly will put more tension on the arm therefore when going for a swing the muscles will be absorbing all of the shock from the initial contact of the ball[19]. Symptoms of tennis elbow include the slow pain which occurs around the elbow. Simple tasks such as shaking hands or moving the wrist with force, like lifting weights or doing push ups, will worsen the pain[21]. Tennis Elbow  has actually shown that inflammatory tendons are only part of the early stages or acute stages with a treatment of anti-inflammatory or steroids being appropriate uses for this symptom[20]. Most players respond well to simple rest, but other means of treatment include physical therapy, strength training, and electrical stimulation[18]. Some players make alterations to their racquet such as increasing grip size which will ultimately prevent any unwanted movement of the wrist when extending out and finishing the tennis stroke[19].
 Shoulder injury is other common types of injury in tennis. Shoulder injury caused by the repetitive use of shoulder[5] when serving and striking the ball. The injury also relevance to rotator cuffs pathology, toscapular dyskinesis or glenohumeral internal rotation deficit which leads to internal impingement and/or labral pathology.[5][6] There is 24% of the high-level tennis players aged 12–19 suffered from shoulder pain and rise up to 50% for middle-aged players.[7]
 It is common for tennis players in all level of play have experienced back injury throughout their career. In fact, more than 85% of the active athletes clarified that they have experienced back pain.[8][9][10][11] According to 148 professional tennis player in one particular study, back pain forcing 39% of players to withdraw from the tournament.[12] Furthermore, 29% of the player said they experienced chronic back pain.[12] Lower back pain is the most common injury amongst tennis players with instances of postural abnormalities and general overuse which may occur during the back rotation and extension of the serve. In order to relieve pain in the lower back people are often told to rest it, but not for more than two days because of its potential damage to the bones, connecting tissue, and cardiovascular system. Once the back pain has dispersed stretching is recommended in order to prevent the stiffness from the initial pain, with examples being the squatting position or spinal extensions. In order to prevent future lower back injuries strength training to the abdominal muscles is necessary because with a stronger abdomen it will protect the back from excessive intervertebral disk strain. The straight crunch, the Oblique crunch, and balance exercises with the gym ball are some of the workouts for abdominal strengthening, but the exercises should be done with caution because if done incorrectly the strain on the back will be amplified. After the injury is dealt with, players of any level return to the court, the higher level players will often go through a thorough stretching period before any matches so they can assure  that they won’t hurt their back or any other part of their body[22].
 Blister can be described as a patch that appears on the skin filled with a clear fluid and sometimes filled with blood. During physical activities, the continuous force of friction, cutting, squeezing and scratching which cause the separation of the epidermal cell layer, as a result the blister is formed.[13] Blister (foot) occurs frequently among marathon runners, walk racers, backpackers and in hiking.[13] In tennis, blister development site often occur on the hand or around the fingers because often time the skin is consistently rubbing against the tennis racquet.

Volleyball injuries,https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Volleyball_injuries,SI," Volleyball is a game played between two opposing sides, with six players on each team, where the players use mainly their hands to hit the ball over a net and try to make the ball land on the opposing team's side of the court.[1] Volleyball is played by over 800 million people world wide, making it one of the most popular sports in the world.[2] Volleyball has some risks involved with it because there are some injuries which occur to players that are quite common; these include ankle injuries, shoulder injuries, foot injuries and knee injuries.
 The majority of sprained ankles in volleyball occur when a player is at the net, either blocking or spiking.[3]  The reason why ankle sprains occur at the net is because both blocking and spiking involve jumping and possibly of landing on an opponent's foot causing the injury. Approximately 50 percent of all sprained ankles in volleyball occur when a blocker lands on the attacking player's foot, while about 25 percent occur when a blocker lands on their own teammate's foot following a block with multiple blockers involved.[4]
 One possible situation that can cause a player to sprain their ankle is when the ball is set too tight or close to the net.[4] As the ball is too close to the net the player who is attempting to spike the ball has to jump closer to the net meaning that they have a higher possibility of landing on or over the center line on the court. By doing this both the blockers and attacker are at an increased risk of spraining their ankle. There are some simple ways in which ankle sprains can be prevented, which include rule changes, technical training and strapping or bracing the ankle.[3]
 There is currently a high number of shoulder injuries in volleyball and it is still unknown to how this number can be managed.[5] Shoulder injuries are great in number because the shoulder is constantly placed under stress during the spiking movements and can often result in injuries to the shoulder.[5][6] The stress is caused by the rotating of the arm around the shoulder joint at a high velocity. There are however multiple spiking techniques, including traditional and alternative techniques, that have different risks to the shoulder.[6] The alternative spiking method is said to be a possible prevention to some injuries that occur in the shoulder and also enhance an athletes performance.[6]
 Jumper's knee is injury term used in volleyball circles that describes the injury known as patella tendinopathy, patella tendinosis or patella tendonitis.[4] Jumper's knee is defined as a syndrome of tendon pain, localized tenderness and that is detrimental to an athletes performance.[7] In the initial phase of the injury the tendons with the knee are usually inflamed.[7] If jumper's knee becomes a chronic injury, which usually occurs as age increases, the tendons show an increasing degree of degeneration and little to no inflation present.[7] As the etiology and pathology of jumper's knee is not known the treatment varies and is largely based on a trial and error basis.[7]
 Jumpers knee is said to occur after frequent actions involving quick accelerations and declarations, eccentric activities and quick cutting actions.[7] As spiking involves jumping, in which a quick acceleration occurs when jumping and quick deceleration when landing, this action is a possible cause of Jumper's knee. Also blocking is a possible cause of Jumper's knee because it to involves jumping and landing quickly. However, Jumper's knee is less common among athletes who compete in beach volleyball rather than those who play indoor volleyball.[4] This is because beach volleyball is played on sand which reduces the impact of landing on the knee.
 There are ways to prevent injuries such as stretching, proper hydration, conditioning, and more.[8] Also, knee pads are necessary to help avoid knee injuries and ankle braces are often used as a way to stabilize the ankles when jumping.[8] The most common volleyball associated injuries are found in the ankles, fingers, shoulders, knees, and the back. These include rotator cuff tendonitis, ACL tear, patellar tendonitis, ligament tears or dislocation in fingers, ankle sprains, and low back pain associated with stress or a herniated disk.[9] Treatment for these injuries includes physical therapy, strength training, and occasionally surgery or a brace. If surgery is needed, the time to return to play may vary depending on the severity of the injury. For a torn ACL, recovery to return is anywhere from 6 to 9 months.[9] Often volleyball injuries are due to poor form when blocking and receiving a serve or a hit. Certainly, there are times where the injuries cannot be prevented and are simply accidental. To avoid injuries, conditioning and stretching are very important as well as correctly executing each play.
